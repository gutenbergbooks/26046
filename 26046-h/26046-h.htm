<h2>PUBLISHERS' NOTE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">John Burroughs's</span> first book, "Wake-Robin,"
contained a chapter entitled "The Invitation."
It was an invitation to the study of
birds. He has reiterated it, implicitly if not explicitly,
in most of the books he has published
since then, and many of his readers have joyfully
accepted it. Indeed, such an invitation
from Mr. Burroughs is the best possible introduction
to the birds of our Northeastern States,
and it is likewise an introduction to some very
good reading. To convey this invitation to a
wider circle of young readers the most interesting
bird stories in Mr. Burroughs's books have
been gathered into a single volume. A chapter
is given to each species of bird, and the chapters
are arranged in a sort of chronological order,
according to the time of the bird's arrival in the
spring, the nesting time, or the season when for
some other reason the species is particularly conspicuous.
In taking the stories out of their original
setting a few slight verbal alterations have
been necessary here and there, but these have
been made either by Mr. Burroughs himself or
with his approval.</p>

<h1>BIRD STORIES FROM BURROUGHS</h1>

<h2>THE BLUEBIRD</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is sure to be a bright March morning when
you first hear the bluebird's note; and it is as
if the milder influences up above had found a
voice and let a word fall upon your ear, so tender
is it and so prophetic, a hope tinged with a
regret.</p>

<p>There never was a happier or more devoted
husband than the male bluebird. He is the
gay champion and escort of the female at all
times, and while she is sitting he feeds her regularly.
It is very pretty to watch them building
their nest. The male is very active in hunting
out a place and exploring the boxes and cavities,
but seems to have no choice in the matter and is
anxious only to please and encourage his mate,
who has the practical turn and knows what will
do and what will not. After she has suited herself
he applauds her immensely, and away the two
go in quest of material for the nest, the male
acting as guard and flying above and in advance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
of the female. She brings all the material and
does all the work of building, he looking on and
encouraging her with gesture and song. He acts
also as inspector of her work, but I fear is a very
partial one. She enters the nest with her bit of
dry grass or straw, and, having adjusted it to
her notion, withdraws and waits near by while he
goes in and looks it over. On coming out he exclaims
very plainly, "Excellent! excellent!" and
away the two go again for more material.</p>

<p>I was much amused one summer day in seeing
a bluebird feeding her young one in the shaded
street of a large town. She had captured a cicada
or harvest-fly, and, after bruising it awhile on
the ground, flew with it to a tree and placed it
in the beak of the young bird. It was a large
morsel, and the mother seemed to have doubts
of her chick's ability to dispose of it, for she stood
near and watched its efforts with great solicitude.
The young bird struggled valiantly with the cicada,
but made no headway in swallowing it,
when the mother took it from him and flew to
the sidewalk, and proceeded to break and bruise
it more thoroughly. Then she again placed it in
his beak, and seemed to say, "There, try it now,"
and sympathized so thoroughly with his efforts
that she repeated many of his motions and contortions.
But the great fly was unyielding, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
indeed, seemed ridiculously disproportioned to
the beak that held it. The young bird fluttered
and fluttered, and screamed, "I'm stuck, I'm
stuck!" till the anxious parent again seized the
morsel and carried it to an iron railing, where
she came down upon it for the space of a minute
with all the force and momentum her beak could
command. Then she offered it to her young a
third time, but with the same result as before,
except that this time the bird dropped it; but
she reached the ground as soon as the cicada did,
and taking it in her beak flew a little distance to
a high board fence, where she sat motionless for
some moments. While pondering the problem
how that fly should be broken, the male bluebird
approached her, and said very plainly, and
I thought rather curtly, "Give me that bug,"
but she quickly resented his interference and
flew farther away, where she sat apparently quite
discouraged when I last saw her.</p>

<hr class="tb1" />

<p>One day in early May, Ted and I made an expedition
to the Shattega, a still, dark, deep stream
that loiters silently through the woods not far
from my cabin. As we paddled along, we were
on the alert for any bit of wild life of bird or
beast that might turn up.</p>

<p>There were so many abandoned woodpecker<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
chambers in the small dead trees as we went along
that I determined to secure the section of a tree
containing a good one to take home and put up
for the bluebirds. "Why don't the bluebirds occupy
them here?" inquired Ted. "Oh," I replied,
"bluebirds do not come so far into the
woods as this. They prefer nesting-places in the
open, and near human habitations." After carefully
scrutinizing several of the trees, we at last
saw one that seemed to fill the bill. It was a
small dead tree-trunk seven or eight inches in
diameter, that leaned out over the water, and from
which the top had been broken. The hole, round
and firm, was ten or twelve feet above us. After
considerable effort I succeeded in breaking the
stub off near the ground, and brought it down
into the boat. "Just the thing," I said; "surely
the bluebirds will prefer this to an artificial box."
But, lo and behold, it already had bluebirds in
it! We had not heard a sound or seen a feather
till the trunk was in our hands, when, on peering
into the cavity, we discovered two young bluebirds
about half grown. This was a predicament
indeed!</p>

<p>Well, the only thing we could do was to stand
the tree-trunk up again as well as we could, and
as near as we could to where it had stood before.
This was no easy thing. But after a time we had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
it fairly well replaced, one end standing in the
mud of the shallow water and the other resting
against a tree. This left the hole to the nest
about ten feet below and to one side of its former
position. Just then we heard the voice of one of
the parent birds, and we quickly paddled to the
other side of the stream, fifty feet away, to watch
her proceedings, saying to each other, "Too
bad! too bad!" The mother bird had a large
beetle in her beak. She alighted upon a limb a
few feet above the former site of her nest, looked
down upon us, uttered a note or two, and then
dropped down confidently to the point in the
vacant air where the entrance to her nest had
been but a few moments before. Here she hovered
on the wing a second or two, looking for
something that was not there, and then returned
to the perch she had just left, apparently not a
little disturbed. She hammered the beetle rather
excitedly upon the limb a few times, as if it were
in some way at fault, then dropped down to try
for her nest again. Only vacant air there! She
hovers and hovers, her blue wings flickering in
the checkered light; surely that precious hole
<i>must</i> be there; but no, again she is baffled, and
again she returns to her perch, and mauls the
poor beetle till it must be reduced to a pulp.
Then she makes a third attempt, then a fourth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and a fifth, and a sixth, till she becomes very much
excited. "What could have happened? am I
dreaming? has that beetle hoodooed me?" she
seems to say, and in her dismay she lets the bug
drop, and looks bewilderedly about her. Then she
flies away through the woods, calling. "Going
for her mate," I said to Ted. "She is in deep
trouble, and she wants sympathy and help."</p>

<p>In a few minutes we heard her mate answer,
and presently the two birds came hurrying to the
spot, both with loaded beaks. They perched
upon the familiar limb above the site of the nest,
and the mate seemed to say, "My dear, what
has happened to you? I can find that nest."
And he dived down, and brought up in the empty
air just as the mother had done. How he winnowed
it with his eager wings! how he seemed
to bear on to that blank space! His mate sat regarding
him intently, confident, I think, that he
would find the clew. But he did not. Baffled and
excited, he returned to the perch beside her.
Then she tried again, then he rushed down once
more, then they both assaulted the place, but it
would not give up its secret. They talked, they encouraged
each other, and they kept up the search,
now one, now the other, now both together.
Sometimes they dropped down to within a few
feet of the entrance to the nest, and we thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
they would surely find it. No, their minds and
eyes were intent only upon that square foot of
space where the nest had been. Soon they withdrew
to a large limb many feet higher up, and
seemed to say to themselves, "Well, it is not
there, but it must be here somewhere; let us
look about." A few minutes elapsed, when we saw
the mother bird spring from her perch and go
straight as an arrow to the nest. Her maternal eye
had proved the quicker. She had found her young.
Something like reason and common sense had
come to her rescue; she had taken time to look
about, and behold! there was that precious doorway.
She thrust her head into it, then sent back a
call to her mate, then went farther in, then withdrew.
"Yes, it is true, they are here, they are
here!" Then she went in again, gave them the
food in her beak, and then gave place to her
mate, who, after similar demonstrations of joy,
also gave them his morsel.</p>

<p>Ted and I breathed freer. A burden had been
taken from our minds and hearts, and we went
cheerfully on our way. We had learned something,
too; we had learned that when in the deep
woods you think of bluebirds, bluebirds may be
nearer you than you think.</p>

<hr class="tb1" />

<p>One mid-April morning two pairs of bluebirds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
were in very active and at times violent courtship
about my grounds. I could not quite understand
the meaning of all the fuss and flutter.
Both birds of each pair were very demonstrative,
but the female in each case the more so. She
followed the male everywhere, lifting and twinkling
her wings, and apparently seeking to win
him by both word and gesture. If she was not
telling him by that cheery, animated, confiding,
softly endearing speech of hers, which she poured
out incessantly, how much she loved him, what
was she saying? She was constantly filled with
a desire to perch upon the precise spot where he
was sitting, and if he had not moved away I
think she would have alighted upon his back.
Now and then, when she flitted away from him,
he followed her with like gestures and tones and
demonstrations of affection, but never with quite
the same ardor. The two pairs kept near each
other, about the house, the bird-boxes, the trees,
the posts and vines in the vineyard, filling the
ear with their soft, insistent warbles, and the eye
with their twinkling azure wings.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/003.jpg" width="337" height="500" alt="" title="" />
BLUEBIRD<br />
Upper, male; lower, female</div>

<p>Was it this constant presence of rivals on both
sides that so stimulated them and kept them up
to such a pitch of courtship? Finally, after I
had watched them over an hour, the birds began
to come into collision. As they met in the vineyard,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the two males clinched and fell to the
ground, lying there for a moment with wings
sprawled out, like birds brought down by a gun.
Then they separated, and each returned to his
mate, warbling and twinkling his wings. Very
soon the females clinched and fell to the ground
and fought savagely, rolling over and over each
other, clawing and tweaking and locking beaks
and hanging on like bull terriers. They did this
repeatedly; once one of the males dashed in and
separated them, by giving one of the females a
sharp tweak and blow. Then the males were at
it again, their blue plumage mixing with the
green grass and ruffled by the ruddy soil. What
a soft, feathery, ineffectual battle it seemed in
both cases!&mdash;no sound, no blood, no flying feathers,
just a sudden mixing up and general disarray
of blue wings and tails and ruddy breasts, there
on the ground; assault but no visible wounds;
thrust of beak and grip of claw, but no feather
loosened and but little ruffling; long holding of
one down by the other, but no cry of pain or
fury. It was the kind of battle that one likes to
witness. The birds usually locked beaks, and
held their grip half a minute at a time. One of
the females would always alight by the struggling
males and lift her wings and utter her soft
notes, but what she said&mdash;whether she was encouraging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
one of the blue coats or berating the
other, or imploring them both to desist, or egging
them on&mdash;I could not tell. So far as I could
understand her speech, it was the same that she
had been uttering to her mate all the time.</p>

<p>When my bluebirds dashed at each other with
beak and claw, their preliminary utterances had
to my ears anything but a hostile sound. Indeed,
for the bluebird to make a harsh, discordant
sound seems out of the question. Once, when
the two males lay upon the ground with outspread
wings and locked beaks, a robin flew
down by them and for a moment gazed intently
at the blue splash upon the grass, and then went
his way.</p>

<p>As the birds drifted about the grounds, first
the males, then the females rolling on the grass
or in the dust in fierce combat, and between
times the members of each pair assuring each
other of undying interest and attachment, I followed
them, apparently quite unnoticed by them.
Sometimes they would lie more than a minute
upon the ground, each trying to keep his own or
to break the other's hold. They seemed so oblivious
of everything about them that I wondered
if they might not at such times fall an easy prey
to cats and hawks. Let me put their watchfulness
to the test, I said. So, as the two males<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
clinched again and fell to the ground, I cautiously
approached them, hat in hand. When ten feet
away and unregarded, I made a sudden dash and
covered them with my hat. The struggle continued
for a few seconds under there, then all
was still. Sudden darkness had fallen upon the
field of battle. What did they think had happened?
Presently their heads and wings began
to brush the inside of my hat. Then all was still
again. Then I spoke to them, called to them, exulted
over them, but they betrayed no excitement
or alarm. Occasionally a head or a body
came in gentle contact with the top or the sides
of my hat.</p>

<p>But the two females were evidently agitated
by the sudden disappearance of their contending
lovers, and began uttering their mournful alarm-note.
After a minute or two I lifted one side of
my hat and out darted one of the birds; then I
lifted the hat from the other. One of the females
then rushed, apparently with notes of joy and
congratulation, to one of the males, who gave
her a spiteful tweak and blow. Then the other
came and he served her the same. He was evidently
a little bewildered, and not certain what
had happened or who was responsible for it.
Did he think the two females were in some way
to blame? But he was soon reconciled to one of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
them again, as was the other male with the other,
yet the two couples did not separate till the males
had come into collision once more. Presently, however,
they drifted apart, and each pair was soon
holding an animated conversation punctuated by
those pretty wing gestures, about the two bird-boxes.</p>

<p>These scenes of love and rivalry had lasted
nearly all the forenoon, and matters between the
birds apparently remained as they were before&mdash;the
members of each pair quite satisfied with
each other. One pair occupied one of the bird-boxes
in the vineyard and reared two broods
there during the season, but the other pair drifted
away and took up their abode somewhere else.</p>

<h2>THE ROBIN</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> long after the bluebird comes the robin.
In large numbers they scour the fields and groves.
You hear their piping in the meadow, in the pasture,
on the hillside. Walk in the woods, and the
dry leaves rustle with the whir of their wings,
the air is vocal with their cheery call. In excess
of joy and vivacity, they run, leap, scream, chase
each other through the air, diving and sweeping
among the trees with perilous rapidity.</p>

<p>In that free, fascinating, half-work-and-half-play
pursuit,&mdash;sugar-making,&mdash;a pursuit which
still lingers in many parts of New York, as in
New England,&mdash;the robin is one's constant companion.
When the day is sunny and the ground
bare, you meet him at all points and hear him at
all hours. At sunset, on the tops of the tall
maples, with look heavenward, and in a spirit of
utter abandonment, he carols his simple strain.
And sitting thus amid the stark, silent trees,
above the wet, cold earth, with the chill of winter
still in the air, there is no fitter or sweeter songster
in the whole round year. It is in keeping
with the scene and the occasion. How round and
genuine the notes are, and how eagerly our ears<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
drink them in! The first utterance, and the spell
of winter is thoroughly broken, and the remembrance
of it afar off.</p>

<p>One of the most graceful of warriors is the
robin. I know few prettier sights than two males
challenging and curveting about each other upon
the grass in early spring. Their attentions to each
other are so courteous and restrained. In alternate
curves and graceful sallies, they pursue and
circumvent each other. First one hops a few feet,
then the other, each one standing erect in true
military style while his fellow passes him and describes
the segment of an ellipse about him, both
uttering the while a fine complacent warble in a
high but suppressed key. Are they lovers or enemies?
the beholder wonders, until they make
a spring and are beak to beak in the twinkling
of an eye, and perhaps mount a few feet into
the air, but rarely actually deliver blows upon
each other. Every thrust is parried, every movement
met. They follow each other with dignified
composure about the fields or lawn, into trees and
upon the ground, with plumage slightly spread,
breasts glowing, their lisping, shrill war-song just
audible. It forms on the whole the most civil and
high-bred tilt to be witnessed during the season.</p>

<p>In the latter half of April, we pass through
what I call the "robin racket,"&mdash;trains of three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
or four birds rushing pell-mell over the lawn and
fetching up in a tree or bush, or occasionally
upon the ground, all piping and screaming at
the top of their voices, but whether in mirth or
anger it is hard to tell. The nucleus of the train
is a female. One cannot see that the males in
pursuit of her are rivals; it seems rather as if they
had united to hustle her out of the place. But
somehow the matches are no doubt made and
sealed during these mad rushes. Maybe the female
shouts out to her suitors, "Who touches
me first wins," and away she scurries like an
arrow. The males shout out, "Agreed!" and
away they go in pursuit, each trying to outdo the
other. The game is a brief one. Before one can
get the clew to it, the party has dispersed.</p>

<hr class="tb1" />

<p>The first year of my cabin life a pair of robins
attempted to build a nest upon the round timber
that forms the plate under my porch roof. But
it was a poor place to build in. It took nearly a
week's time and caused the birds a great waste
of labor to find this out. The coarse material
they brought for the foundation would not bed
well upon the rounded surface of the timber, and
every vagrant breeze that came along swept it
off. My porch was kept littered with twigs and
weed-stalks for days, till finally the birds abandoned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the undertaking. The next season a wiser or
more experienced pair made the attempt again, and
succeeded. They placed the nest against the rafter
where it joins the plate; they used mud from
the start to level up with and to hold the first
twigs and straws, and had soon completed a firm,
shapely structure. When the young were about
ready to fly, it was interesting to note that there
was apparently an older and a younger, as in most
families. One bird was more advanced than any
of the others. Had the parent birds intentionally
stimulated it with extra quantities of food, so as
to be able to launch their offspring into the
world one at a time? At any rate, one of the birds
was ready to leave the nest a day and a half before
any of the others. I happened to be looking
at it when the first impulse to get outside the
nest seemed to seize it. Its parents were encouraging
it with calls and assurances from some
rocks a few yards away. It answered their calls
in vigorous, strident tones. Then it climbed over
the edge of the nest upon the plate, took a few
steps forward, then a few more, till it was a yard
from the nest and near the end of the timber,
and could look off into free space. Its parents
apparently shouted, "Come on!" But its courage
was not quite equal to the leap; it looked
around, and, seeing how far it was from home,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
scampered back to the nest, and climbed into it
like a frightened child. It had made its first journey
into the world, but the home tie had brought it
quickly back. A few hours afterward it journeyed
to the end of the plate again, and then turned
and rushed back. The third time its heart was
braver, its wings stronger, and, leaping into the
air with a shout, it flew easily to some rocks a
dozen or more yards away. Each of the young
in succession, at intervals of nearly a day, left
the nest in this manner. There would be the first
journey of a few feet along the plate, the first
sudden panic at being so far from home, the
rush back, a second and perhaps a third attempt,
and then the irrevocable leap into the air, and a
clamorous flight to a near-by bush or rock.
Young birds never go back when they have once
taken flight. The first free flap of the wings
severs forever the ties that bind them to home.</p>

<hr class="tb1" />

<p>I recently observed a robin boring for grubs
in a country dooryard. It is a common enough
sight to witness one seize an angle-worm and
drag it from its burrow in the turf, but I am not
sure that I ever before saw one drill for grubs
and bring the big white morsel to the surface.
The robin I am speaking of had a nest of young
in a maple near by, and she worked the neighborhood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
very industriously for food. She would
run along over the short grass after the manner
of robins, stopping every few feet, her form stiff
and erect. Now and then she would suddenly
bend her head toward the ground and bring eye
or ear for a moment to bear intently upon it.
Then she would spring to boring the turf vigorously
with her bill, changing her attitude at each
stroke, alert and watchful, throwing up the grass
roots and little jets of soil, stabbing deeper and
deeper, growing every moment more and more
excited, till finally a fat grub was seized and
brought forth. Time after time, during several
days, I saw her mine for grubs in this way and
drag them forth. How did she know where to
drill? The insect was in every case an inch below
the surface. Did she hear it gnawing the
roots of the grasses, or did she see a movement
in the turf beneath which the grub was at work?
I know not. I only know that she struck her
game unerringly each time. Only twice did I
see her make a few thrusts and then desist, as if
she had been for the moment deceived.</p>

<h2>THE FLICKER</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Another</span> April comer, who arrives shortly after
Robin Redbreast, with whom he associates both
at this season and in the autumn, is the golden-winged
woodpecker, <i>alias</i> "high-hole," <i>alias</i>
"flicker," <i>alias</i> "yarup," <i>alias</i> "yellow-hammer."
He is an old favorite of my boyhood, and
his note to me means very much. He announces
his arrival by a long, loud call, repeated from the
dry branch of some tree, or a stake in the fence,&mdash;a
thoroughly melodious April sound. I think
how Solomon finished that beautiful description
of spring, "and the voice of the turtle is heard
in our land," and see that a description of spring
in this farming country, to be equally characteristic,
should culminate in like manner,&mdash;"and the
call of the high-hole comes up from the wood."
It is a loud, strong, sonorous call, and does not
seem to imply an answer, but rather to subserve
some purpose of love or music. It is "Yarup's"
proclamation of peace and good-will to all.</p>

<p>I recall an ancient maple standing sentry to a
large sugar-bush, that, year after year, afforded
protection to a brood of yellow-hammers in its
decayed heart. A week or two before the nesting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
seemed actually to have begun, three or four
of these birds might be seen, on almost any
bright morning, gamboling and courting amid
its decayed branches. Sometimes you would hear
only a gentle persuasive cooing, or a quiet confidential
chattering; then that long, loud call,
taken up by first one, then another, as they sat
about upon the naked limbs; anon, a sort of
wild, rollicking laughter, intermingled with various
cries, yelps, and squeals, as if some incident
had excited their mirth and ridicule. Whether
this social hilarity and boisterousness is in celebration
of the pairing or mating ceremony, or
whether it is only a sort of annual "house-warming"
common among high-holes on resuming
their summer quarters, is a question upon which
I reserve my judgment.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 358px;">
<img src="images/004.jpg" width="358" height="500" alt="" title="" />
FLICKER</div>

<p>Unlike most of his kinsmen, the golden-wing
prefers the fields and the borders of the forest
to the deeper seclusion of the woods, and hence,
contrary to the habit of his tribe, obtains most
of his subsistence from the ground, probing it
for ants and crickets. He is not quite satisfied
with being a woodpecker. He courts the society
of the robin and the finches, abandons the trees
for the meadow, and feeds eagerly upon berries
and grain. What may be the final upshot of this
course of living is a question worthy the attention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of Darwin. Will his taking to the ground
and his pedestrian feats result in lengthening his
legs, his feeding upon berries and grains subdue
his tints and soften his voice, and his associating
with Robin put a song into his heart?</p>

<hr class="tb1" />

<p>In the cavity of an apple-tree, much nearer the
house than they usually build, a pair of high-holes
took up their abode. A knot-hole which led
to the decayed interior was enlarged, the live
wood being cut away as clean as a squirrel would
have done it. The inside preparations I could
not witness, but day after day, as I passed near,
I heard the bird hammering away, evidently beating
down obstructions and shaping and enlarging
the cavity. The chips were not brought out, but
were used rather to floor the interior. The woodpeckers
are not nest-builders, but rather nest-carvers.</p>

<p>The time seemed very short before the voices
of the young were heard in the heart of the old
tree,&mdash;at first feebly, but waxing stronger day
by day until they could be heard many rods distant.
When I put my hand upon the trunk of
the tree, they would set up an eager, expectant
chattering; but if I climbed up it toward the
opening, they soon detected the unusual sound
and would hush quickly, only now and then uttering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
a warning note. Long before they were fully
fledged they clambered up to the orifice to receive
their food. As but one could stand in the
opening at a time, there was a good deal of elbowing
and struggling for this position. It was a
very desirable one aside from the advantages it
had when food was served; it looked out upon
the great, shining world, into which the young
birds seemed never tired of gazing. The fresh
air must have been a consideration also, for the
interior of a high-hole's dwelling is not sweet.
When the parent birds came with food, the young
one in the opening did not get it all, but after
he had received a portion, either on his own motion
or on a hint from the old one, he would give
place to the one behind him. Still, one bird evidently
outstripped his fellows, and in the race of
life was two or three days in advance of them.
His voice was loudest and his head oftenest at
the window. But I noticed that, when he had
kept the position too long, the others evidently
made it uncomfortable in his rear, and, after
"fidgeting" about awhile, he would be compelled
to "back down." But retaliation was then
easy, and I fear his mates spent few easy moments
at that lookout. They would close their
eyes and slide back into the cavity as if the world
had suddenly lost all its charms for them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>This bird was, of course, the first to leave the
nest. For two days before that event he kept his
position in the opening most of the time and sent
forth his strong voice incessantly. The old ones
abstained from feeding him almost entirely, no
doubt to encourage his exit. As I stood looking
at him one afternoon and noting his progress, he
suddenly reached a resolution,&mdash;seconded, I have
no doubt, from the rear,&mdash;and launched forth
upon his untried wings. They served him well,
and carried him about fifty yards up-hill the first
heat. The second day after, the next in size and
spirit left in the same manner; then another, till
only one remained. The parent birds ceased their
visits to him, and for one day he called and
called till our ears were tired of the sound. His
was the faintest heart of all. Then he had none
to encourage him from behind. He left the nest
and clung to the outer bole of the tree, and yelped
and piped for an hour longer; then he committed
himself to his wings and went his way like the
rest.</p>

<p>The matchmaking of the high-holes, which
often comes under my observation, is in marked
contrast to that of the robins and the bluebirds.
There does not appear to be any anger or any
blows. The male or two males will alight on a
limb in front of the female, and go through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
with a series of bowings and scrapings that are
truly comical. He spreads his tail, he puffs
out his breast, he throws back his head and
then bends his body to the right and to the
left, uttering all the while a curious musical
hiccough. The female confronts him unmoved,
but whether her attitude is critical or defensive,
I cannot tell. Presently she flies away, followed
by her suitor or suitors, and the little
comedy is enacted on another stump or tree.
Among all the woodpeckers the drum plays an
important part in the matchmaking. The male
takes up his stand on a dry, resonant limb, or
on the ridgeboard of a building, and beats the
loudest call he is capable of. A favorite drum of
the high-holes about me is a hollow wooden tube,
a section of a pump, which stands as a bird-box
upon my summer-house. It is a good instrument;
its tone is sharp and clear. A high-hole alights
upon it, and sends forth a rattle that can be
heard a long way off. Then he lifts up his head
and utters that long April call, <i>Wick, wick, wick,
wick</i>. Then he drums again. If the female does
not find him, it is not because he does not make
noise enough. But his sounds are all welcome to
the ear. They are simple and primitive, and voice
well a certain sentiment of the April days. As I
write these lines I hear through the half-open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
door his call come up from a distant field. Then
I hear the steady hammering of one that has been
for three days trying to penetrate the weather
boarding of the big icehouse by the river, and
to reach the sawdust filling for a nesting-place.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE PH&#338;BE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Another</span> April bird whose memory I fondly
cherish is the ph&#339;be-bird, the pioneer of the flycatchers.
In the inland farming districts, I used
to notice him, on some bright morning about
Easter Day, proclaiming his arrival, with much
variety of motion and attitude, from the peak of
the barn or hay-shed. As yet, you may have
heard only the plaintive, homesick note of the
bluebird, or the faint trill of the song sparrow;
and the ph&#339;be's clear, vivacious assurance of his
veritable bodily presence among us again is welcomed
by all ears. At agreeable intervals in his
lay he describes a circle or an ellipse in the air,
ostensibly prospecting for insects, but really, I
suspect, as an artistic flourish, thrown in to make
up in some way for the deficiency of his musical
performance. If plainness of dress indicates
powers of song, as it usually does, the ph&#339;be
ought to be unrivaled in musical ability, for
surely that ashen-gray suit is the superlative of
plainness; and that form, likewise, would hardly
pass for a "perfect figure" of a bird. The seasonableness
of his coming, however, and his civil,
neighborly ways, shall make up for all deficiencies
in song and plumage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>The ph&#339;be-bird is a wise architect and perhaps
enjoys as great an immunity from danger, both
in its person and its nest, as any other bird. Its
modest ashen-gray suit is the color of the rocks
where it builds, and the moss of which it makes
such free use gives to its nest the look of a natural
growth or accretion. But when it comes into
the barn or under the shed to build, as it so
frequently does, the moss is rather out of place.
Doubtless in time the bird will take the hint, and
when she builds in such places will leave the moss
out. I noted but two nests the summer I am
speaking of: one in a barn failed of issue, on
account of the rats, I suspect, though the little
owl may have been the depredator; the other, in
the woods, sent forth three young. This latter
nest was most charmingly and ingeniously placed.
I discovered it while in quest of pond-lilies, in a
long, deep, level stretch of water in the woods.
A large tree had blown over at the edge of the
water, and its dense mass of upturned roots, with
the black, peaty soil filling the interstices, was
like the fragment of a wall several feet high, rising
from the edge of the languid current. In a
niche in this earthy wall, and visible and accessible
only from the water, a ph&#339;be had built her
nest and reared her brood. I paddled my boat up
and came alongside prepared to take the family<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
aboard. The young, nearly ready to fly, were
quite undisturbed by my presence, having probably
been assured that no danger need be apprehended
from that side. It was not a likely
place for minks, or they would not have been so
secure.</p>

<h2>THE COWBIRD</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> cow blackbird is a noticeable songster in
April, though it takes a back seat a little later.
It utters a peculiarly liquid April sound. Indeed,
one would think its crop was full of water, its
notes so bubble up and regurgitate, and are delivered
with such an apparent stomachic contraction.
This bird is the only feathered polygamist
we have. The females are greatly in excess of
the males, and the latter are usually attended by
three or four of the former. As soon as the
other birds begin to build, they are on the <i>qui
vive</i>, prowling about like gypsies, not to steal
the young of others, but to steal their eggs into
other birds' nests, and so shirk the labor and responsibility
of hatching and rearing their own
young.</p>

<p>The cowbird's tactics are probably to watch
the movements of the parent bird. She may often
be seen searching anxiously through the trees or
bushes for a suitable nest, yet she may still oftener
be seen perched upon some good point of
observation watching the birds as they come and
go about her. There is no doubt that, in many
cases, the cowbird makes room for her own illegitimate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
egg in the nest by removing one of the
bird's own. I found a sparrow's nest with two
sparrow's eggs and one cowbird's egg, and another
egg lying a foot or so below it on the
ground. I replaced the ejected egg, and the
next day found it again removed, and another
cowbird's egg in its place. I put it back the second
time, when it was again ejected, or destroyed,
for I failed to find it anywhere. Very alert and
sensitive birds, like the warblers, often bury the
strange egg beneath a second nest built on top
of the old. A lady living in the suburbs of an
Eastern city heard cries of distress one morning
from a pair of house wrens that had a nest in a
honeysuckle on her front porch. On looking out
of the window, she beheld this little comedy,&mdash;comedy
from her point of view, but no doubt
grim tragedy from the point of view of the
wrens: a cowbird with a wren's egg in its beak
running rapidly along the walk, with the outraged
wrens forming a procession behind it,
screaming, scolding, and gesticulating as only
these voluble little birds can. The cowbird had
probably been surprised in the act of violating
the nest, and the wrens were giving her a piece
of their minds.</p>

<p>Every cowbird is reared at the expense of two
or more song-birds. For every one of these dusky<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
little pedestrians there amid the grazing cattle
there are two or more sparrows, or vireos, or
warblers, the less. It is a big price to pay,&mdash;two
larks for a bunting,&mdash;two sovereigns for a
shilling; but Nature does not hesitate occasionally
to contradict herself in just this way. The
young of the cowbird is disproportionately large
and aggressive, one might say hoggish. When
disturbed, it will clasp the nest and scream and
snap its beak threateningly. One was hatched out
in a song sparrow's nest which was under my observation,
and would soon have overridden and
overborne the young sparrow which came out of
the shell a few hours later, had I not interfered
from time to time and lent the young sparrow a
helping hand. Every day I would visit the nest
and take the sparrow out from under the potbellied
interloper, and place it on top, so that
presently it was able to hold its own against its
enemy. Both birds became fledged and left the
nest about the same time. Whether the race was
an even one after that, I know not.</p>

<h2>THE CHIPPING SPARROW</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the true flycatcher catches a fly, it is
quick business. There is no strife, no pursuit,&mdash;one
fell swoop, and the matter is ended. Now
note that yonder little sparrow is less skilled. It is
the chippy, and he finds his subsistence properly
in various seeds and the larv&aelig; of insects,
though he occasionally has higher aspirations,
and seeks to emulate the pewee, commencing and
ending his career as a flycatcher by an awkward
chase after a beetle or "miller." He is hunting
around in the grass now, I suspect, with the desire
to indulge this favorite whim. There!&mdash;the
opportunity is afforded him. Away goes a little
cream-colored meadow-moth in the most tortuous
course he is capable of, and away goes Chippy
in pursuit. The contest is quite comical, though
I dare say it is serious enough to the moth. The
chase continues for a few yards, when there is a
sudden rushing to cover in the grass,&mdash;then a
taking to wing again, when the search has become
too close, and the moth has recovered his
wind. Chippy chirps angrily, and is determined
not to be beaten. Keeping, with the slightest
effort, upon the heels of the fugitive, he is ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
on the point of halting to snap him up, but
never quite does it; and so, between disappointment
and expectation, is soon disgusted, and
returns to pursue his more legitimate means of
subsistence.</p>

<hr class="tb1" />

<p>Last summer I made this record in my notebook:
"A nest of young robins in the maple in
front of the house being fed by a chipping sparrow.
The little sparrow is very attentive; seems
decidedly fond of her adopted babies. The old
robins resent her services, and hustle her out of
the tree whenever they find her near the nest.
(It was this hurried departure of Chippy from
the tree that first attracted my attention.) She
watches her chances, and comes with food in
their absence. The young birds are about ready
to fly, and when the chippy feeds them her head
fairly disappears in their capacious mouths. She
jerks it back as if she were afraid of being swallowed.
Then she lingers near them on the edge of
the nest, and seems to admire them. When she sees
the old robin coming, she spreads her wings in an
attitude of defense, and then flies away. I wonder
if she has had the experience of rearing a
cow-bunting?" (A day later.) "The robins are
out of the nest, and the little sparrow continues
to feed them. She approaches them rather timidly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and hesitatingly, as if she feared they might
swallow her, then thrusts her titbit quickly into
the distended mouth and jerks back."</p>

<p>Whether the chippy had lost her own brood,
whether she was an unmated bird, or whether
the case was simply the overflowing of the maternal
instinct, it would be interesting to know.</p>

<h2>THE CHEWINK</h2>

<div class="figright" style="width: 368px;">
<img src="images/005.jpg" width="368" height="500" alt="" title="" />
CHEWINK<br />
Upper, male; lower, female</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> chewink is a shy bird, but not stealthy.
It is very inquisitive, and sets up a great scratching
among the leaves, apparently to attract your
attention. The male is perhaps the most conspicuously
marked of all the ground-birds except
the bobolink, being black above, bay on the
sides, and white beneath. The bay is in compliment
to the leaves he is forever scratching among,&mdash;they
have rustled against his breast and sides
so long that these parts have taken their color;
but whence come the white and the black? The
bird seems to be aware that his color betrays him,
for there are few birds in the woods so careful
about keeping themselves screened from view.
When in song, its favorite perch is the top of
some high bush near to cover. On being disturbed
at such times, it pitches down into the
brush and is instantly lost to view.</p>

<p>This is the bird that Thomas Jefferson wrote
to Wilson about, greatly exciting the latter's curiosity.
Wilson was just then upon the threshold
of his career as an ornithologist, and had
made a drawing of the Canada jay which he sent
to the President. It was a new bird, and in reply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Jefferson called his attention to a "curious
bird" which was everywhere to be heard, but
scarcely ever to be seen. He had for twenty
years interested the young sportsmen of his
neighborhood to shoot one for him, but without
success. "It is in all the forests, from spring to
fall," he says in his letter, "and never but on
the tops of the tallest trees, from which it perpetually
serenades us with some of the sweetest
notes, and as clear as those of the nightingale. I
have followed it for miles, without ever but once
getting a good view of it. It is of the size and
make of the mockingbird, lightly thrush-colored
on the back, and a grayish-white on the breast
and belly. Mr. Randolph, my son-in-law, was in
possession of one which had been shot by a
neighbor," etc. Randolph pronounced it a flycatcher,
which was a good way wide of the mark.
Jefferson must have seen only the female, after
all his tramp, from his description of the color;
but he was doubtless following his own great
thoughts more than the bird, else he would have
had an earlier view. The bird was not a new one,
but was well known then as the ground-robin.
The President put Wilson on the wrong scent
by his erroneous description, and it was a long
time before the latter got at the truth of the
case. But Jefferson's letter is a good sample of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
those which specialists often receive from intelligent
persons who have seen or heard something
in their line very curious or entirely new, and
who set the man of science agog by a description
of the supposed novelty,&mdash;a description that
generally fits the facts of the case about as well
as your coat fits the chair-back. Strange and curious
things in the air, and in the water, and in
the earth beneath, are seen every day except by
those who are looking for them, namely, the
naturalists. When Wilson or Audubon gets his
eye on the unknown bird, the illusion vanishes,
and your phenomenon turns out to be one of the
commonplaces of the fields or woods.</p>

<h2>THE BROWN THRASHER</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> long-tailed thrush, or thrasher, delights
in a high branch of some solitary tree, whence it
will pour out its rich and intricate warble for an
hour together. This bird is the great American
chipper. There is no other bird that I know of
that can chip with such emphasis and military
decision as this yellow-eyed songster. It is like
the click of a giant gunlock. Why is the thrasher
so stealthy? It always seems to be going about
on tip-toe. I never knew it to steal anything, and
yet it skulks and hides like a fugitive from justice.
One never sees it flying aloft in the air and
traversing the world openly, like most birds,
but it darts along fences and through bushes as
if pursued by a guilty conscience. Only when
the musical fit is upon it does it come up into
full view, and invite the world to hear and behold.</p>

<p>Years pass without my finding a brown thrasher's
nest; it is not a nest you are likely to stumble
upon in your walk; it is hidden as a miser hides
his gold, and watched as jealously. The male
pours out his rich and triumphant song from the
tallest tree he can find, and fairly challenges you to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
come and look for his treasures in his vicinity. But
you will not find them if you go. The nest is somewhere
on the outer circle of his song; he is never
so imprudent as to take up his stand very near it.
The artists who draw those cozy little pictures of
a brooding mother bird, with the male perched but
a yard away in full song, do not copy from nature.
The thrasher's nest I found was thirty or
forty rods from the point where the male was
wont to indulge in his brilliant recitative. It was
in an open field under a low ground-juniper. My
dog disturbed the sitting bird as I was passing
near. The nest could be seen only by lifting up
and parting away the branches. All the arts of
concealment had been carefully studied. It was
the last place you would think of looking in, and,
if you did look, nothing was visible but the dense
green circle of the low-spreading juniper. When
you approached, the bird would keep her place
till you had begun to stir the branches, when
she would start out, and, just skimming the
ground, make a bright brown line to the near
fence and bushes. I confidently expected that
this nest would escape molestation, but it did not.
Its discovery by myself and dog probably opened
the door for ill luck, as one day, not long afterward,
when I peeped in upon it, it was empty. The
proud song of the male had ceased from his accustomed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
tree, and the pair were seen no more
in that vicinity.</p>

<p>After a pair of nesting birds have been broken
up once or twice during the season, they become
almost desperate, and will make great efforts to
outwit their enemies. A pair of brown thrashers
built their nest in a pasture-field under a low,
scrubby apple-tree which the cattle had browsed
down till it spread a thick, wide mass of thorny
twigs only a few inches above the ground. Some
blackberry briers had also grown there, so that the
screen was perfect. My dog first started the bird,
as I was passing near. By stooping low and peering
intently, I could make out the nest and eggs.
Two or three times a week, as I passed by, I
would pause to see how the nest was prospering.
The mother bird would keep her place, her yellow
eyes never blinking. One morning, as I looked
into her tent, I found the nest empty. Some
night-prowler, probably a skunk or a fox, or
maybe a black snake or a red squirrel by day,
had plundered it. It would seem as if it was too
well screened; it was in such a spot as any depredator
would be apt to explore. "Surely," he
would say, "this is a likely place for a nest."
The birds then moved over the hill a hundred
rods or more, much nearer the house, and in some
rather open bushes tried again. But again they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
came to grief. Then, after some delay, the mother
bird made a bold stroke. She seemed to
reason with herself thus: "Since I have fared so
disastrously in seeking seclusion for my nest, I
will now adopt the opposite tactics, and come
out fairly in the open. What hides me hides my
enemies: let us try greater publicity." So she
came out and built her nest by a few small shoots
that grew beside the path that divides the two
vineyards, and where we passed to and fro many
times daily. I discovered her by chance early in
the morning as I proceeded to my work. She
started up at my feet and flitted quickly along
above the ploughed ground, almost as red as the
soil. I admired her audacity. Surely no prowler
by night or day would suspect a nest in this open
and exposed place. There was no cover by which
they could approach, and no concealment anywhere.
The nest was a hasty affair, as if the
birds' patience at nest-building had been about
exhausted. Presently an egg appeared, and then
the next day another, and on the fourth day a
third. No doubt the bird would have succeeded
this time had not man interfered. In cultivating
the vineyards the horse and cultivator had to
pass over this very spot. Upon this the bird had
not calculated. I determined to assist her. I
called my man, and told him there was one spot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
in that vineyard, no bigger than his hand, where
the horse's foot must not be allowed to fall, nor
tooth of cultivator to touch. Then I showed him
the nest, and charged him to avoid it. Probably
if I had kept the secret to myself, and let the
bird run her own risk, the nest would have escaped.
But the result was that the man, in elaborately
trying to avoid the nest, overdid the
matter; the horse plunged, and set his foot
squarely upon it. Such a little spot, the chances
were few that the horse's foot would fall exactly
there; and yet it did, and the birds' hopes were
again dashed. The pair then disappeared from
my vicinity, and I saw them no more.</p>

<h2>THE HOUSE WREN</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> years ago I put up a little bird-house
in the back end of my garden for the accommodation
of the wrens, and every season a pair have
taken up their abode there. One spring a pair of
bluebirds looked into the tenement and lingered
about several days, leading me to hope that they
would conclude to occupy it. But they finally
went away, and later in the season the wrens appeared,
and, after a little coquetting, were regularly
installed in their old quarters, and were as
happy as only wrens can be.</p>

<p>One of our younger poets, Myron Benton, saw
a little bird</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"Ruffled with whirlwind of his ecstasies,"<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="noin">which must have been the wren, as I know of no
other bird that so throbs and palpitates with music
as this little vagabond. And the pair I speak
of seemed exceptionally happy, and the male had
a small tornado of song in his crop that kept
him "ruffled" every moment in the day. But before
their honeymoon was over the bluebirds returned.
I knew something was wrong before I was
up in the morning. Instead of that voluble and
gushing song outside the window, I heard the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
wrens scolding and crying at a fearful rate, and
on going out saw the bluebirds in possession of
the box. The poor wrens were in despair; they
wrung their hands and tore their hair, after the
wren fashion, but chiefly did they rattle out their
disgust and wrath at the intruders. I have no
doubt that, if it could have been interpreted, it
would have been proven the rankest and most
voluble billingsgate ever uttered. For the wren
is saucy, and he has a tongue in his head that
can outwag any other tongue known to me.</p>

<p>The bluebirds said nothing, but the male kept
an eye on Mr. Wren, and, when he came too
near, gave chase, driving him to cover under the
fence, or under a rubbish-heap or other object,
where the wren would scold and rattle away,
while his pursuer sat on the fence or the pea-brush
waiting for him to reappear.</p>

<p>Days passed, and the usurpers prospered and
the outcasts were wretched; but the latter lingered
about, watching and abusing their enemies, and
hoping, no doubt, that things would take a turn,
as they presently did. The outraged wrens were
fully avenged. The mother bluebird had laid her
full complement of eggs and was beginning to
set, when one day, as her mate was perched above
her on the barn, along came a boy with one of
those wicked elastic slings and cut him down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
with a pebble. There he lay like a bit of sky
fallen upon the grass. The widowed bird seemed
to understand what had happened, and without
much ado disappeared next day in quest of another
mate.</p>

<p>In the mean time the wrens were beside themselves
with delight; they fairly screamed with joy.
If the male was before "ruffled with whirlwind
of his ecstasies," he was now in danger of being
rent asunder. He inflated his throat and caroled
as wren never caroled before. And the female,
too, how she cackled and darted about! How
busy they both were! Rushing into the nest,
they hustled those eggs out in less than a minute,
wren time. They carried in new material,
and by the third day were fairly installed again
in their old quarters; but on the third day, so
rapidly are these little dramas played, the female
bluebird reappeared with another mate. Ah! how
the wren stock went down then! What dismay
and despair filled again those little breasts! It
was pitiful. They did not scold as before, but
after a day or two withdrew from the garden,
dumb with grief, and gave up the struggle.</p>

<hr class="tb1" />

<p>The chatter of a second brood of nearly fledged
wrens is heard now (August 20) in an oriole's
nest suspended from the branch of an apple-tree<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
near where I write. Earlier in the season the
parent birds made long and determined attempts
to establish themselves in a cavity that had been
occupied by a pair of bluebirds. The original
proprietor of the place was the downy woodpecker.
He had excavated it the autumn before,
and had passed the winter there, often to my
certain knowledge lying abed till nine o'clock in
the morning. In the spring he went elsewhere,
probably with a female, to begin the season in
new quarters. The bluebirds early took possession,
and in June their first brood had flown.
The wrens had been hanging around, evidently
with an eye on the place (such little comedies
may be witnessed anywhere), and now very naturally
thought it was their turn. A day or two
after the young bluebirds had flown, I noticed
some fine, dry grass clinging to the entrance to
the cavity; a circumstance which I understood
a few moments later, when the wren rushed by
me into the cover of a small Norway spruce,
hotly pursued by the male bluebird. It was a
brown streak and a blue streak pretty close together.
The wrens had gone to housecleaning,
and the bluebird had returned to find his bed
and bedding being pitched out of doors, and
had thereupon given the wrens to understand in
the most emphatic manner that he had no intention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of vacating the premises so early in the season.
Day after day, for more than two weeks, the
male bluebird had to clear his premises of these
intruders. It occupied much of his time and not
a little of mine, as I sat with a book in a summer-house
near by, laughing at his pretty fury and
spiteful onset. On two occasions the wren rushed
under the chair in which I sat, and a streak of
blue lightning almost flashed in my very face.
One day, just as I had passed the tree in which
the cavity was located, I heard the wren scream
desperately; turning, I saw the little vagabond
fall into the grass with the wrathful bluebird
fairly upon him; the latter had returned just in
time to catch him, and was evidently bent on
punishing him well. But in the squabble in the
grass the wren escaped and took refuge in the
friendly evergreen. The bluebird paused for a
moment with outstretched wings looking for the
fugitive, then flew away. A score of times during
the month of June did I see the wren taxing
every energy to get away from the bluebird. He
would dart into the stone wall, under the floor of
the summer-house, into the weeds,&mdash;anywhere
to hide his diminished head. The bluebird, with
his bright coat, looked like an officer in uniform
in pursuit of some wicked, rusty little street
gamin. Generally the favorite house of refuge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of the wrens was the little spruce, into which
their pursuer made no attempt to follow them.
The female would sit concealed amid the branches,
chattering in a scolding, fretful way, while the
male with his eye upon his tormentor would
perch on the topmost shoot and sing. Why he
sang at such times, whether in triumph and derision,
or to keep his courage up and reassure his
mate, I could not make out. When his song was
suddenly cut short, and I glanced to see him dart
down into the spruce, my eye usually caught a
twinkle of blue wings hovering near. The wrens
finally gave up the fight, and their enemies reared
their second brood in peace.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE SONG SPARROW</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first song sparrow's nest I observed in the
spring of 1881 was in a field under a fragment of
a board, the board being raised from the ground
a couple of inches by two poles. It had its full
complement of eggs, and probably sent forth a
brood of young birds, though as to this I cannot
speak positively, as I neglected to observe it further.
It was well sheltered and concealed, and was
not easily come at by any of its natural enemies,
save snakes and weasels. But concealment often
avails little. In May, a song sparrow, which had
evidently met with disaster earlier in the season,
built its nest in a thick mass of woodbine against
the side of my house, about fifteen feet from the
ground. Perhaps it took the hint from its cousin
the English sparrow. The nest was admirably
placed, protected from the storms by the overhanging
eaves and from all eyes by the thick
screen of leaves. Only by patiently watching the
suspicious bird, as she lingered near with food in
her beak, did I discover its whereabouts. That
brood is safe, I thought, beyond doubt. But it
was not: the nest was pillaged one night, either
by an owl, or else by a rat that had climbed into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the vine, seeking an entrance to the house. The
mother bird, after reflecting upon her ill luck
about a week, seemed to resolve to try a different
system of tactics, and to throw all appearances
of concealment aside. She built a nest a
few yards from the house, beside the drive, upon
a smooth piece of greensward. There was not a
weed or a shrub or anything whatever to conceal
it or mark its site. The structure was completed,
and incubation had begun, before I discovered
what was going on. "Well, well," I said, looking
down upon the bird almost at my feet, "this is going
to the other extreme indeed; now the cats
will have you." The desperate little bird sat there
day after day, looking like a brown leaf pressed
down in the short green grass. As the weather
grew hot, her position became very trying. It
was no longer a question of keeping the eggs
warm, but of keeping them from roasting. The
sun had no mercy on her, and she fairly panted
in the middle of the day. In such an emergency
the male robin has been known to perch above
the sitting female and shade her with his outstretched
wings. But in this case there was no
perch for the male bird, had he been disposed to
make a sunshade of himself. I thought to lend a
hand in this direction myself, and so stuck a leafy
twig beside the nest. This was probably an unwise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
interference: it guided disaster to the spot;
the nest was broken up, and the mother bird was
probably caught, as I never saw her afterward.</p>

<p>One day a tragedy was enacted a few yards
from where I was sitting with a book: two song
sparrows were trying to defend their nest against
a black snake. The curious, interrogating note
of a chicken who had suddenly come upon the
scene in his walk first caused me to look up from
my reading. There were the sparrows, with
wings raised in a way peculiarly expressive of
horror and dismay, rushing about a low clump
of grass and bushes. Then, looking more closely,
I saw the glistening form of the black snake, and
the quick movement of his head as he tried to
seize the birds. The sparrows darted about and
through the grass and weeds, trying to beat the
snake off. Their tails and wings were spread, and,
panting with the heat and the desperate struggle,
they presented a most singular spectacle. They
uttered no cry, not a sound escaped them; they
were plainly speechless with horror and dismay.
Not once did they drop their wings, and the
peculiar expression of those uplifted palms, as
it were, I shall never forget. It occurred to me
that perhaps here was a case of attempted bird-charming
on the part of the snake, so I looked
on from behind the fence. The birds charged the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
snake and harassed him from every side, but were
evidently under no spell save that of courage in
defending their nest. Every moment or two I
could see the head and neck of the serpent make
a sweep at the birds, when the one struck at would
fall back, and the other would renew the assault
from the rear. There appeared to be little danger
that the snake could strike and hold one of
the birds, though I trembled for them, they were
so bold and approached so near to the snake's
head. Time and again he sprang at them, but
without success. How the poor things panted, and
held up their wings appealingly! Then the snake
glided off to the near fence, barely escaping the
stone which I hurled at him. I found the nest
rifled and deranged; whether it had contained
eggs or young, I know not. The male sparrow
had cheered me many a day with his song,
and I blamed myself for not having rushed
at once to the rescue, when the arch enemy
was upon him. There is probably little truth in
the popular notion that snakes charm birds. The
black snake is the most subtle, alert, and devilish
of our snakes, and I have never seen him have
any but young, helpless birds in his mouth.</p>

<hr class="tb1" />

<p>If one has always built one's nest upon the
ground, and if one comes of a race of ground-builders,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
it is a risky experiment to build in a
tree. The conditions are vastly different. One of
my near neighbors, a little song sparrow, learned
this lesson the past season. She grew ambitious;
she departed from the traditions of her race, and
placed her nest in a tree. Such a pretty spot she
chose, too,&mdash;the pendent cradle formed by the interlaced
sprays of two parallel branches of a Norway
spruce. These branches shoot out almost horizontally;
indeed, the lower ones become quite so
in spring, and the side shoots with which they are
clothed droop down, forming the slopes of miniature
ridges; where the slopes of two branches
join, a little valley is formed, which often looks
more stable than it really is. My sparrow selected
one of these little valleys about six feet from the
ground, and quite near the walls of the house.
"Here," she thought, "I will build my nest, and
pass the heat of June in a miniature Norway.
This tree is the fir-clad mountain, and this little
vale on its side I select for my own." She carried
up a great quantity of coarse grass and straws
for the foundation, just as she would have done
upon the ground. On the top of this mass there
gradually came into shape the delicate structure
of her nest, compacting and refining till its delicate
carpet of hairs and threads was reached. So
sly as the little bird was about it, too,&mdash;every moment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
on her guard lest you discover her secret!
Five eggs were laid, and incubation was far advanced,
when the storms and winds came. The
cradle indeed did rock. The boughs did not break,
but they swayed and separated as you would part
your two interlocked hands. The ground of the
little valley fairly gave way, the nest tilted over
till its contents fell into the chasm. It was like
an earthquake that destroys a hamlet.</p>

<p>No born tree-builder would have placed its
nest in such a situation. Birds that build at the
end of the branch, like the oriole, tie the nest
fast; others, like the robin, build against the
main trunk; still others build securely in the
fork. The sparrow, in her ignorance, rested her
house upon the spray of two branches, and when
the tempest came, the branches parted company
and the nest was engulfed.</p>

<p>A little bob-tailed song sparrow built her nest
in a pile of dry brush very near the kitchen door
of a farmhouse on the skirts of the northern
Catskills, where I was passing the summer. It was
late in July, and she had doubtless reared one
brood in the earlier season. Her toilet was decidedly
the worse for wear. I noted her day after
day, very busy about the fence and quince bushes
between the house and milk house, with her beak
full of coarse straw and hay. To a casual observer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
she seemed flitting about aimlessly, carrying
straws from place to place just to amuse herself.
When I came to watch her closely to learn the
place of her nest, she seemed to suspect my intention,
and made many little feints and movements
calculated to put me off my track. But
I would not be misled, and presently had her
secret. The male did not assist her at all, but
sang much of the time in an apple-tree or upon
the fence, on the other side of the house.</p>

<p>The song sparrow nearly always builds upon
the ground, but my little neighbor laid the foundations
of her domicile a foot or more above the
soil. And what a mass of straws and twigs she
did collect together! How coarse and careless
and aimless at first,&mdash;a mere lot of rubbish
dropped upon the tangle of dry limbs; but
presently how it began to refine and come into
shape in the centre! till there was the most exquisite
hair-lined cup set about by a chaos of
coarse straws and branches. What a process of
evolution! The completed nest was foreshadowed
by the first stiff straw; but how far off is yet
that dainty casket with its complement of speckled
eggs! The nest was so placed that it had for
canopy a large, broad, drooping leaf of yellow
dock. This formed a perfect shield against both
sun and rain, while it served to conceal it from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
any curious eyes from above,&mdash;from the cat,
for instance, prowling along the top of the wall.
Before the eggs had hatched, the docken leaf
wilted and dried and fell down upon the nest.
But the mother bird managed to insinuate herself
beneath it, and went on with her brooding
all the same.</p>

<p>Then I arranged an artificial cover of leaves
and branches, which shielded her charge till
they had flown away. A mere trifle was this
little bob-tailed bird with her arts and her secrets,
and the male with his song, and yet the
pair gave a touch of something to those days and
to that place which I would not willingly have
missed.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE CHIMNEY SWIFT</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day a swarm of honey-bees went into my
chimney, and I mounted the stack to see into
which flue they had gone. As I craned my neck
above the sooty vent, with the bees humming
about my ears, the first thing my eye rested upon
in the black interior was a pair of long white
pearls upon a little shelf of twigs, the nest of the
chimney swallow, or swift,&mdash;honey, soot, and
birds' eggs closely associated. The bees, though
in an unused flue, soon found the gas of anthracite
that hovered about the top of the chimney
too much for them, and they left. But the swifts
are not repelled by smoke. They seem to have
entirely abandoned their former nesting-places
in hollow trees and stumps, and to frequent only
chimneys. A tireless bird, never perching, all
day upon the wing, and probably capable of flying
one thousand miles in twenty-four hours,
they do not even stop to gather materials for
their nests, but snap off the small dry twigs
from the tree-tops as they fly by. Confine one of
these swifts to a room and it does not perch, but
after flying till it becomes bewildered and exhausted,
it clings to the side of the wall till it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
dies. Once, on returning to my room after several
days' absence, I found one in which life seemed
nearly extinct; its feet grasped my finger as I
removed it from the wall, but its eyes closed, and
it seemed about on the point of joining its companion,
which lay dead upon the floor. Tossing it
into the air, however, seemed to awaken its wonderful
powers of flight, and away it went straight
toward the clouds. On the wing the chimney
swift looks like an athlete stripped for the race.
There is the least appearance of quill and plumage
of any of our birds, and, with all its speed
and marvelous evolutions, the effect of its flight
is stiff and wiry. There appears to be but one
joint in the wing, and that next the body. This
peculiar inflexible motion of the wings, as if they
were little sickles of sheet iron, seems to be
owing to the length and development of the primary
quills and the smallness of the secondary.
The wing appears to hinge only at the wrist.
The barn swallow lines its rude masonry with
feathers, but the swift begins life on bare twigs,
glued together by a glue of home manufacture
as adhesive as Spaulding's.</p>

<p>The big chimney of my cabin "Slabsides" of
course attracted the chimney swifts, and as it was
not used in summer, two pairs built their nests
in it, and we had the muffled thunder of their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
wings at all hours of the day and night. One
night, when one of the broods was nearly fledged,
the nest that held them fell down into the fireplace.
Such a din of screeching and chattering
as they instantly set up! Neither my dog nor I
could sleep. They yelled in chorus, stopping at
the end of every half-minute as if upon signal.
Now they were all screeching at the top of their
voices, then a sudden, dead silence ensued. Then
the din began again, to terminate at the instant
as before. If they had been long practicing together,
they could not have succeeded better. I
never before heard the cry of birds so accurately
timed. After a while I got up and put them
back up the chimney, and stopped up the throat
of the flue with newspapers. The next day one
of the parent birds, in bringing food to them,
came down the chimney with such force that it
passed through the papers and brought up in
the fireplace. On capturing it I saw that its
throat was distended with food as a chipmunk's
cheek with corn, or a boy's pocket with chestnuts.
I opened its mandibles, when it ejected a
wad of insects as large as a bean. Most of them
were much macerated, but there were two house-flies
yet alive and but little the worse for their
close confinement. They stretched themselves and
walked about upon my hand, enjoying a breath<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of fresh air once more. It was nearly two hours
before the swift again ventured into the chimney
with food.</p>

<p>These birds do not perch, nor alight upon
buildings or the ground. They are apparently upon
the wing all day. They outride the storms. I
have in my mind a cheering picture of three of
them I saw facing a heavy thunder-shower one
afternoon. The wind was blowing a gale, the
clouds were rolling in black, portentous billows
out of the west, the peals of thunder were shaking
the heavens, and the big drops were just beginning
to come down, when, on looking up, I saw
three swifts high in air, working their way slowly,
straight into the teeth of the storm. They were
not hurried or disturbed; they held themselves
firmly and steadily; indeed, they were fairly at
anchor in the air till the rage of the elements
should have subsided. I do not know that any
other of our land birds outride the storms in this
way.</p>

<p>In the choice of nesting-material the swift
shows no change of habit. She still snips off the
small dry twigs from the tree-tops and glues them
together, and to the side of the chimney, with
her own glue. The soot is a new obstacle in her
way, that she does not yet seem to have learned
to overcome, as the rains often loosen it and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
cause her nest to fall to the bottom. She has a
pretty way of trying to frighten you off when
your head suddenly darkens the opening above
her. At such times she leaves the nest and clings
to the side of the chimney near it. Then, slowly
raising her wings, she suddenly springs out from
the wall and back again, making as loud a drumming
with them in the passage as she is capable of.
If this does not frighten you away, she repeats it
three or four times. If your face still hovers
above her, she remains quiet and watches you.</p>

<p>What a creature of the air this bird is, never
touching the ground, so far as I know, and never
tasting earthly food! The swallow does perch
now and then and descend to the ground for
nesting-material, but not so the swift. The twigs
for her nest she gathers on the wing, sweeping
along like children on a "merry-go-round" who
try to seize a ring, or to do some other feat, as
they pass a given point. If the swift misses the
twig, or it fails to yield to her the first time, she
tries again and again, each time making a wider
circuit, as if to tame and train her steed a little
and bring him up more squarely to the mark next
time.</p>

<p>Though the swift is a stiff flyer and apparently
without joints in her wings, yet the air of
frolic and of superabundance of wing-power is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
more marked with her than with any other of our
birds. Her feeding and twig-gathering seem like
asides in a life of endless play. Several times both
in spring and fall I have seen swifts gather in
immense numbers toward nightfall, to take refuge
in large unused chimney-stacks. On such occasions
they seem to be coming together for some
aerial festival or grand celebration; and, as if
bent upon a final effort to work off a part of
their superabundant wing-power before settling
down for the night, they circle and circle high
above the chimney-top, a great cloud of them,
drifting this way and that, all in high spirits and
chippering as they fly. Their numbers constantly
increase as other members of the clan come dashing
in from all points of the compass. Swifts
seem to materialize out of empty air on all sides
of the chippering, whirling ring, as an hour or
more this assembling of the clan and this flight
festival go on. The birds must gather in from
whole counties, or from half a State. They have
been on the wing all day, and yet now they seem
as tireless as the wind, and as if unable to curb
their powers.</p>

<p>One fall they gathered in this way and took
refuge for the night in a large chimney-stack in
a city near me, and kept this course up for more
than a month and a half. Several times I went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to town to witness the spectacle, and a spectacle
it was: ten thousand swifts, I should think, filling
the air above a whole square like a whirling
swarm of huge black bees, but saluting the
ear with a multitudinous chippering, instead of a
humming. People gathered upon the sidewalks
to see them. It was a rare circus performance,
free to all. After a great many feints and playful
approaches, the whirling ring of birds would
suddenly grow denser above the chimney; then
a stream of them, as if drawn down by some
power of suction, would pour into the opening.
For only a few seconds would this downward
rush continue; then, as if the spirit of frolic had
again got the upper hand of them, the ring would
rise, and the chippering and circling go on. In a
minute or two the same man&#339;uvre would be repeated,
the chimney, as it were, taking its swallows
at intervals to prevent choking. It usually
took a half-hour or more for the birds all to disappear
down its capacious throat. There was always
an air of timidity and irresolution about
their approach to the chimney, just as there always
is about their approach to the dead tree-top
from which they procure their twigs for nest-building.
Often did I see birds hesitate above the
opening and then pass on, apparently as though
they had not struck it at just the right angle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
On one occasion a solitary bird was left flying,
and it took three or four trials either to make up
its mind or to catch the trick of the descent. On
dark or threatening or stormy days the birds
would begin to assemble by mid-afternoon, and
by four or five o'clock were all in their lodgings.</p>

<h2>THE OVEN-BIRD</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> loiterer about the woods knows this
pretty, speckled-breasted, olive-backed little bird,
which walks along over the dry leaves a few yards
from him, moving its head as it walks, like a
miniature domestic fowl. Most birds are very
stiff-necked, like the robin, and as they run or
hop upon the ground, carry the head as if it were
riveted to the body. Not so the oven-bird, or the
other birds that walk, as the cow-bunting, or the
quail, or the crow. They move the head forward
with the movement of the feet. The sharp, reiterated,
almost screeching song of the oven-bird, as
it perches on a limb a few feet from the ground,
like the words "preacher, preacher, preacher,"
or "teacher, teacher, teacher," uttered louder and
louder, and repeated six or seven times, is also
familiar to most ears; but its wild, ringing, rapturous
burst of song in the air high above the
tree-tops is not so well known. From a very prosy,
tiresome, unmelodious singer, it is suddenly transformed
for a brief moment into a lyric poet of
great power. It is a great surprise. The bird undergoes
a complete transformation. Ordinarily it
is a very quiet, demure sort of bird. It walks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
about over the leaves, moving its head like a
little hen; then perches on a limb a few feet from
the ground and sends forth its shrill, rather prosy,
unmusical chant. Surely it is an ordinary, commonplace
bird. But wait till the inspiration of
its flight-song is upon it. What a change! Up
it goes through the branches of the trees, leaping
from limb to limb, faster and faster, till it shoots
from the tree-tops fifty or more feet into the air
above them, and bursts into an ecstasy of song,
rapid, ringing, lyrical; no more like its habitual
performance than a match is like a rocket; brief
but thrilling; emphatic but musical. Having
reached its climax of flight and song, the bird
closes its wings and drops nearly perpendicularly
downward like the skylark. If its song were more
prolonged, it would rival the song of that famous
bird. The bird does this many times a day
during early June, but oftenest at twilight.</p>

<p>About the first of June there is a nest in the
woods, upon the ground, with four creamy-white
eggs in it, spotted with brown or lilac, chiefly
about the larger ends, that always gives the
walker who is so lucky as to find it a thrill of
pleasure. It is like a ground sparrow's nest with
a roof or canopy to it. The little brown or olive
backed bird starts away from your feet and runs
swiftly and almost silently over the dry leaves,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and then turns her speckled breast to see if you
are following. She walks very prettily, by far the
prettiest pedestrian in the woods. But if she
thinks you have discovered her secret, she feigns
lameness and disability of both leg and wing, to
decoy you into the pursuit of her. This is the
oven-bird. The last nest of this bird I found was
while in quest of the pink cypripedium. We suddenly
spied a couple of the flowers a few steps
from the path along which we were walking, and
had stooped to admire them, when out sprang
the bird from beside them, doubtless thinking
she was the subject of observation instead of
the rose-purple flowers that swung but a foot
or two above her. But we never should have
seen her had she kept her place. She had found
a rent in the matted carpet of dry leaves and pine
needles that covered the ground, and into this
had insinuated her nest, the leaves and needles
forming a canopy above it, sloping to the south
and west, the source of the more frequent summer
rains.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE CATBIRD</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> requires an effort for me to speak of the
singing catbird as he; all the ways and tones of
the bird seem so distinctly feminine. But it is,
of course, only the male that sings. At times
I hardly know whether I am more pleased or
annoyed with him. Perhaps he is a little too
common, and his part in the general chorus a little
too conspicuous. If you are listening for the
note of another bird, he is sure to be prompted
to the most loud and protracted singing, drowning
all other sounds; if you sit quietly down to
observe a favorite or study a new-comer, his curiosity
knows no bounds, and you are scanned and
ridiculed from every point of observation. Yet I
would not miss him; I would only subordinate
him a little, make him less conspicuous.</p>

<p>He is the parodist of the woods, and there is
ever a mischievous, bantering, half-ironical undertone
in his lay, as if he were conscious of mimicking
and disconcerting some envied songster.
Ambitious of song, practicing and rehearsing in
private, he yet seems the least sincere and genuine
of the sylvan minstrels, as if he had taken up
music only to be in the fashion, or not to be outdone<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
by the robins and thrushes. In other words,
he seems to sing from some outward motive, and
not from inward joyousness. He is a good versifier,
but not a great poet. Vigorous, rapid, copious,
not without fine touches, but destitute of
any high, serene melody, his performance, like
that of Thoreau's squirrel, always implies a spectator.</p>

<p>There is a certain air and polish about his
strain, however, like that in the vivacious conversation
of a well-bred lady of the world, that
commands respect. His parental instinct, also, is
very strong, and that simple structure of dead
twigs and dry grass is the centre of much anxious
solicitude. Not long since, while strolling
through the woods, my attention was attracted
to a small densely-grown swamp, hedged in with
eglantine, brambles, and the everlasting smilax,
from which proceeded loud cries of distress and
alarm, indicating that some terrible calamity was
threatening my sombre-colored minstrel. On effecting
an entrance, which, however, was not accomplished
till I had doffed coat and hat, so as
to diminish the surface exposed to the thorns and
brambles, and, looking around me from a square
yard of terra firma, I found myself the spectator
of a loathsome yet fascinating scene. Three or
four yards from me was the nest, beneath which,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
in long festoons, rested a huge black snake; a
bird two-thirds grown was slowly disappearing
between his expanded jaws. As he seemed unconscious
of my presence, I quietly observed the proceedings.
By slow degrees he compassed the bird
about with his elastic mouth; his head flattened,
his neck writhed and swelled, and two or three
undulatory movements of his glistening body finished
the work. Then he cautiously raised himself
up, his tongue flaming from his mouth the
while, curved over the nest, and, with wavy, subtle
motions, explored the interior. I can conceive
of nothing more overpoweringly terrible to an
unsuspecting family of birds than the sudden appearance
above their domicile of the head and
neck of this arch-enemy. It is enough to petrify
the blood in their veins. Not finding the object
of his search, he came streaming down from the
nest to a lower limb, and commenced extending
his researches in other directions, sliding stealthily
through the branches, bent on capturing one
of the parent birds. That a legless, wingless
creature should move with such ease and rapidity
where only birds and squirrels are considered at
home, lifting himself up, letting himself down,
running out on the yielding boughs, and traversing
with marvelous celerity the whole length and
breadth of the thicket, was truly surprising. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
thinks of the great myth of the Tempter and the
"cause of all our woe," and wonders if the Arch
Enemy is not now playing off some of his pranks
before him. Whether we call it snake or devil
matters little. I could but admire his terrible
beauty, however; his black, shining folds, his
easy, gliding movement, head erect, eyes glistening,
tongue playing like subtle flame, and the invisible
means of his almost winged locomotion.</p>

<p>The parent birds, in the mean while, kept
up the most agonizing cry, at times fluttering
furiously about their pursuer, and actually laying
hold of his tail with their beaks and claws. On
being thus attacked, the snake would suddenly
double upon himself and follow his own body
back, thus executing a strategic movement that
at first seemed almost to paralyze his victim and
place her within his grasp. Not quite, however.
Before his jaws could close upon the coveted prize
the bird would tear herself away, and, apparently
faint and sobbing, retire to a higher branch. His
reputed powers of fascination availed him little,
though it is possible that a frailer and less combative
bird might have been held by the fatal
spell. Presently, as he came gliding down the
slender body of a leaning alder, his attention was
attracted by a slight movement of my arm; eyeing
me an instant, with that crouching, utterly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
motionless gaze which I believe only snakes and
devils can assume, he turned quickly&mdash;a feat
which necessitated something like crawling over
his own body&mdash;and glided off through the
branches, evidently recognizing in me a representative
of the ancient parties he once so cunningly
ruined. A few moments later, as he lay
carelessly disposed in the top of a rank alder, trying
to look as much like a crooked branch as his
supple, shining form would admit, the old vengeance
overtook him. I exercised my prerogative,
and a well-directed missile, in the shape of a stone,
brought him looping and writhing to the ground.
After I had completed his downfall and quiet had
been partly restored, a half-fledged member of
the bereaved household came out from his hiding-place,
and, jumping upon a decayed branch,
chirped vigorously, no doubt in celebration of the
victory.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE BOBOLINK</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bobolink has a secure place in literature,
having been laureated by no less a poet than
Bryant, and invested with a lasting human charm
in the sunny page of Irving, and is the only one
of our songsters, I believe, that the mockingbird
cannot parody or imitate. He affords the most
marked example of exuberant pride, and a glad,
rollicking, holiday spirit, that can be seen among
our birds. Every note expresses complacency and
glee. He is a beau of the first pattern, and, unlike
any other bird of my acquaintance, pushes
his gallantry to the point of wheeling gayly into
the train of every female that comes along, even
after the season of courtship is over and the
matches are all settled; and when she leads him
on too wild a chase, he turns lightly about and
breaks out with a song that is precisely analogous
to a burst of gay and self-satisfied laughter, as
much as to say, "<i>Ha! ha! ha! I must have my
fun, Miss Silverthimble, thimble, thimble, if I
break every heart in the meadow, see, see, see!</i>"</p>

<p>At the approach of the breeding-season the
bobolink undergoes a complete change; his form
changes, his color changes, his flight changes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
From mottled brown or brindle he becomes black
and white, earning, in some localities, the shocking
name of "skunk bird"; his small, compact
form becomes broad and conspicuous, and his
ordinary flight is laid aside for a mincing, affected
gait, in which he seems to use only the very tips
of his wings. It is very noticeable what a contrast
he presents to his mate at this season, not
only in color but in manners, she being as shy
and retiring as he is forward and hilarious. Indeed,
she seems disagreeably serious and indisposed
to any fun or jollity, scurrying away at
his approach, and apparently annoyed at every
endearing word and look. It is surprising that
all this parade of plumage and tinkling of cymbals
should be gone through with and persisted
in to please a creature so coldly indifferent as she
really seems to be.</p>

<p>I know of no other song-bird that expresses
so much self-consciousness and vanity, and comes
so near being an ornithological coxcomb. The
redbird, the yellowbird, the indigo-bird, the oriole,
the cardinal grosbeak, and others, all birds of
brilliant plumage and musical ability, seem quite
unconscious of self, and neither by tone nor act
challenge the admiration of the beholder.</p>

<p>If I were a bird, in building my nest I should
follow the example of the bobolink, placing it in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the midst of a broad meadow, where there was
no spear of grass, or flower, or growth unlike
another to mark its site. I judge that the bobolink
escapes the dangers to which nesting birds
are liable as few or no other birds do. Unless the
mowers come along at an earlier date than she
has anticipated, that is, before July 1, or a skunk
goes nosing through the grass, which is unusual,
she is as safe as bird well can be in
the great open of nature. She selects the most
monotonous and uniform place she can find
amid the daisies or the timothy and clover, and
places her simple structure upon the ground in
the midst of it. There is no concealment,
except as the great conceals the little, as the
desert conceals the pebble, as the myriad conceals
the unit. You may find the nest once, if your
course chances to lead you across it, and your
eye is quick enough to note the silent brown
bird as she darts swiftly away; but step three
paces in the wrong direction, and your search
will probably be fruitless. My friend and I found
a nest by accident one day, and then lost it again
one minute afterward. I moved away a few yards
to be sure of the mother bird, charging my friend
not to stir from his tracks. When I returned, he
had moved two paces, he said (he had really
moved four), and we spent a half-hour stooping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
over the daisies and the buttercups, looking for
the lost clew. We grew desperate, and fairly felt
the ground over with our hands, but without
avail. I marked the spot with a bush, and came
the next day, and, with the bush as a centre,
moved about it in slowly increasing circles, covering,
I thought, nearly every inch of ground with
my feet, and laying hold of it with all the visual
power I could command, till my patience was exhausted,
and I gave up, baffled. I began to doubt
the ability of the parent birds themselves to find
it, and so secreted myself and watched. After
much delay, the male bird appeared with food in
his beak, and, satisfying himself that the coast
was clear, dropped into the grass which I had
trodden down in my search. Fastening my eye
upon a particular meadow-lily, I walked straight
to the spot, bent down, and gazed long and intently
into the grass. Finally my eye separated
the nest and its young from its surroundings.
My foot had barely missed them in my search,
but by how much they had escaped my eye I
could not tell. Probably not by distance at all,
but simply by unrecognition. They were virtually
invisible. The dark gray and yellowish-brown
dry grass and stubble of the meadow-bottom were
exactly copied in the color of the half-fledged
young. More than that, they hugged the nest so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
closely and formed such a compact mass, that
though there were five of them, they preserved
the unit of expression,&mdash;no single head or form
was defined; they were one, and that one was
without shape or color, and not separable, except
by closest scrutiny, from the one of the meadow-bottom.
That nest prospered, as bobolinks' nests
doubtless generally do; for, notwithstanding the
enormous slaughter of the birds by Southern
sportsmen during their fall migrations, the bobolink
appears to hold its own, and its music does
not diminish in our Northern meadows.</p>

<h2>THE WOOD THRUSH</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wood thrush is the handsomest species of
the thrush family. In grace and elegance of
manner he has no equal. Such a gentle, high-bred
air, and such inimitable ease and composure
in his flight and movement! He is a poet in very
word and deed. His carriage is music to the eye.
His performance of the commonest act, as catching
a beetle, or picking a worm from the mud,
pleases like a stroke of wit or eloquence. Was
he a prince in the olden time, and do the regal
grace and mien still adhere to him in his transformation?
What a finely proportioned form!
How plain, yet rich, his color,&mdash;the bright russet
of his back, the clear white of his breast,
with the distinct heart-shaped spots! It may be
objected to Robin that he is noisy and demonstrative;
he hurries away or rises to a branch
with an angry note, and flirts his wings in ill-bred
suspicion. The thrasher, or red thrush, sneaks
and skulks like a culprit, hiding in the densest
alders; the catbird is a coquette and a flirt, as
well as a sort of female Paul Pry; and the chewink
shows his inhospitality by espying your
movements like a detective. The wood thrush<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
has none of these underbred traits. He regards
me unsuspiciously, or avoids me with a noble reserve&mdash;or,
if I am quiet and incurious, graciously
hops toward me, as if to pay his respects,
or to make my acquaintance. I have passed under
his nest within a few feet of his mate and brood,
when he sat near by on a branch eying me
sharply, but without opening his beak; but the
moment I raised my hand toward his defenseless
household his anger and indignation were beautiful
to behold.</p>

<p>What a noble pride he has! Late one October,
after his mates and companions had long since
gone South, I noticed one for several successive
days in the dense part of this next-door wood,
flitting noiselessly about, very grave and silent,
as if doing penance for some violation of the code
of honor. By many gentle, indirect approaches, I
perceived that part of his tail-feathers were undeveloped.
The sylvan prince could not think of
returning to court in this plight, and so, amid
the falling leaves and cold rains of autumn, was
patiently biding his time.</p>

WOOD THRUSH</div>

<p>It is a curious habit the wood thrush has of
starting its nest with a fragment of newspaper or
other paper. Except in remote woods, I think it
nearly always puts a piece of paper in the foundation
of its nest. Last spring I chanced to be sitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
near a tree in which a wood thrush had concluded
to build. She came with a piece of paper nearly
as large as my hand, placed it upon the branch,
stood upon it a moment, and then flew down to the
ground. A little puff of wind caused the paper
to leave the branch a moment afterward. The
thrush watched it eddy slowly down to the
ground, when she seized it and carried it back.
She placed it in position as before, stood upon it
again for a moment, and then flew away. Again
the paper left the branch, and sailed away slowly
to the ground. The bird seized it again, jerking
it about rather spitefully, I thought; she turned
it round two or three times, then labored back
to the branch with it, upon which she shifted it
about as if to hit upon some position in which it
would lie more securely. This time she sat down
upon it for a moment, and then went away,
doubtless with the thought in her head that she
would bring something to hold it down. The
perverse paper followed her in a few seconds.
She seized it again, and hustled it about more
than before. As she rose with it toward the nest,
it in some way impeded her flight, and she was
compelled to return to the ground with it. But
she kept her temper remarkably well. She turned
the paper over and took it up in her beak several
times before she was satisfied with her hold, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
then carried it back to the branch, where, however,
it would not stay. I saw her make six trials
of it, when I was called away. I think she finally
abandoned the restless fragment, probably a scrap
that held some "breezy" piece of writing, for
later in the season I examined the nest and found
no paper in it.</p>

<p>How completely the life of a bird revolves
about its nest, its home! In the case of the wood
thrush, its life and joy seem to mount higher and
higher as the nest prospers. The male becomes a
fountain of melody; his happiness waxes day by
day; he makes little triumphal tours about the
neighborhood, and pours out his pride and gladness
in the ears of all. How sweet, how well-bred,
is his demonstration! But let any accident befall
that precious nest, and what a sudden silence
falls upon him! Last summer a pair of wood
thrushes built their nest within a few rods of
my house, and when the enterprise was fairly
launched and the mother bird was sitting upon
her four blue eggs, the male was in the height
of his song. How he poured forth his rich melody,
never in the immediate vicinity of the nest,
but always within easy hearing distance! Every
morning, as promptly as the morning came, between
five and six, he would sing for half an
hour from the top of a locust-tree that shaded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
my roof. I came to expect him as much as I expected
my breakfast, and I was not disappointed
till one morning I seemed to miss something.
What was it? Oh, the thrush had not sung this
morning. Something is the matter; and, recollecting
that yesterday I had seen a red squirrel
in the trees not far from the nest, I at once inferred
that the nest had been harried. Going to
the spot, I found my fears were well grounded;
every egg was gone. The joy of the thrush was
laid low. No more songs from the tree-top, and
no more songs from any point, till nearly a week
had elapsed, when I heard him again under the
hill, where the pair had started a new nest, cautiously
tuning up, and apparently with his recent
bitter experience still weighing upon him.</p>

<p>There is no nest-builder that suffers more
from crows and squirrels and other enemies than
the wood thrush. It builds as openly and unsuspiciously
as if it thought all the world as honest
as itself. Its favorite place is the fork of a
sapling, eight or ten feet from the ground, where
it falls an easy prey to every nest-robber that
comes prowling through the woods and groves.
It is not a bird that skulks and hides, like the
catbird, the brown thrasher, the chat, or the chewink,
and its nest is not concealed with the same
art as theirs. Our thrushes are all frank, open-mannered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
birds; but the veery and the hermit
build on the ground, where they may at least escape
the crows, owls, and jays, and stand a good
chance of being overlooked by the red squirrel
and weasel also; while the robin seeks the protection
of dwellings and outbuildings. For years
I have not known the nest of a wood thrush to
succeed. During the season referred to I observed
but two, both apparently a second attempt,
as the season was well advanced, and both failures.
In one case, the nest was placed in a branch
that an apple-tree, standing near a dwelling, held
out over the highway. The structure was barely
ten feet above the middle of the road, and would
just escape a passing load of hay. It was made
conspicuous by the use of a large fragment of
newspaper in its foundation,&mdash;an unsafe material
to build upon in most cases. Whatever else
the press may guard, this particular newspaper
did not guard this nest from harm. It saw the
egg and probably the chick, but not the fledgeling.
A murderous deed was committed above
the public highway, but whether in the open day
or under cover of darkness I have no means of
knowing. The frisky red squirrel was doubtless
the culprit. The other nest was in a maple sapling,
within a few yards of the little rustic summer-house
already referred to. The first attempt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of the season, I suspect, had failed in a more secluded
place under the hill; so the pair had come
up nearer the house for protection. The male
sang in the trees near by for several days before
I chanced to see the nest. The very morning, I
think, it was finished, I saw a red squirrel exploring
a tree but a few yards away; he probably
knew what the singing meant as well as I
did. I did not see the inside of the nest, for it
was almost instantly deserted, the female having
probably laid a single egg, which the squirrel
had devoured.</p>

<p>One evening, while seated upon my porch, I
had convincing proof that musical or song contests
do take place among the birds. Two wood
thrushes who had nests near by sat on the top
of a dead tree and pitted themselves against each
other in song for over half an hour, contending
like champions in a game, and certainly affording
the rarest treat in wood-thrush melody I had
ever had. They sang and sang with unwearied
spirit and persistence, now and then changing
position or facing in another direction, but keeping
within a few feet of each other. The rivalry
became so obvious and was so interesting that I
finally made it a point not to take my eyes from
the singers. The twilight deepened till their
forms began to grow dim; then one of the birds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
could stand the strain no longer, the limit of fair
competition had been reached, and seeming to
say, "I will silence you, anyhow," it made a
spiteful dive at its rival, and in hot pursuit the
two disappeared in the bushes beneath the tree.</p>

<h2>THE BALTIMORE ORIOLE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> nest of nests, the ideal nest, is unquestionably
that of the Baltimore oriole. It is the
only perfectly pensile nest we have. The nest of
the orchard oriole is indeed mainly so, but this
bird generally builds lower and shallower, more
after the manner of the vireos.</p>

<p>The Baltimore oriole loves to attach its nest to
the swaying branches of the tallest elms, making
no attempt at concealment, but satisfied if the
position be high and the branch pendent. This
nest would seem to cost more time and skill
than any other bird structure. A peculiar flax-like
material seems to be always sought after and
always found. The nest when completed assumes
the form of a large, suspended gourd. The walls
are thin but firm, and proof against the most
driving rain. The mouth is hemmed or over-handed
with strings or horsehair, and the sides
are usually sewed through and through with the
same.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/007.jpg" width="400" height="500" alt="" title="" />
BALTIMORE ORIOLE<br />
Upper, male; lower, female</div>

<p>Not particular as to the matter of secrecy, the
bird is not particular as to material, so that it
be of the nature of strings or threads. A lady
friend once told me that, while she was working<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
by an open window, one of these birds approached
while her back was turned, and, seizing a skein
of some kind of thread or yarn, made off with
it to its half-finished nest. But the perverse yarn
caught fast in the branches, and, in the bird's
efforts to extricate it, got hopelessly tangled.
She tugged away at it all day, but was finally
obliged to content herself with a few detached
portions. The fluttering strings were an eyesore
to her ever after, and, passing and repassing,
she would give them a spiteful jerk, as much
as to say, "There is that confounded yarn that
gave me so much trouble."</p>

<p>One day in Kentucky I saw an oriole weave
into her nest unusual material. As we sat upon
the lawn in front of the cottage, we had noticed
the bird just beginning her structure, suspending
it from a long, low branch of the Kentucky
coffee-tree that grew but a few feet away. I suggested
to my host that if he would take some
brilliant yarn and scatter it about upon the
shrubbery, the fence, and the walks, the bird
would probably avail herself of it, and weave a
novel nest. I had heard of its being done, but
had never tried it myself. The suggestion was
at once acted upon, and in a few moments a handful
of zephyr yarn, crimson, orange, green, yellow,
and blue, was distributed about the grounds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
As we sat at dinner a few moments later, I saw
the eager bird flying up toward her nest with
one of these brilliant yarns streaming behind
her. They had caught her eye at once, and she
fell to work upon them with a will; not a bit
daunted by their brilliant color, she soon had a
crimson spot there amid the green leaves. She
afforded us rare amusement all the afternoon and
the next morning. How she seemed to congratulate
herself over her rare find! How vigorously
she knotted those strings to her branch and
gathered the ends in and sewed them through
and through the structure, jerking them spitefully
like a housewife burdened with many cares!
How savagely she would fly at her neighbor, an
oriole that had a nest just over the fence a few
yards away, when she invaded her territory! The
male looked on approvingly, but did not offer to
lend a hand. There is something in the manner
of the female on such occasions, something so
decisive and emphatic, that one entirely approves
of the course of the male in not meddling or offering
any suggestions. It is the wife's enterprise,
and she evidently knows her own mind so well
that the husband keeps aloof, or plays the part
of an approving spectator.</p>

<p>The woolen yarn was ill-suited to the Kentucky
climate. This fact the bird seemed to appreciate,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
for she used it only in the upper part
of her nest, in attaching it to the branch and in
binding and compacting the rim, making the
sides and bottom of hemp, leaving it thin and
airy, much more so than are the same nests with
us. No other bird would, perhaps, have used
such brilliant material; their instincts of concealment
would have revolted, but the oriole
aims more to make its nest inaccessible than to
hide it. Its position and depth insure its safety.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE WHIP-POOR-WILL</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day in May, walking in the woods, I
came upon the nest of a whip-poor-will, or rather its
eggs, for it builds no nest,&mdash;two elliptical whitish
spotted eggs lying upon the dry leaves. My foot
was within a yard of the mother bird before she
flew. I wondered what a sharp eye would detect
curious or characteristic in the ways of the bird,
so I came to the place many times and had a
look. It was always a task to separate the bird
from her surroundings, though I stood within a
few feet of her, and knew exactly where to look.
One had to bear on with his eye, as it were, and
refuse to be baffled. The sticks and leaves, and
bits of black or dark-brown bark, were all exactly
copied in the bird's plumage. And then she
did sit so close, and simulate so well a shapeless,
decaying piece of wood or bark! Twice I brought
a companion, and, guiding his eye to the spot,
noted how difficult it was for him to make out
there, in full view upon the dry leaves, any semblance
to a bird. When the bird returned after
being disturbed, she would alight within a few
inches of her eggs, and then, after a moment's
pause, hobble awkwardly upon them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 359px;">
<img src="images/008.jpg" width="359" height="500" alt="" title="" />
WHIP-POOR-WILL</div>

<p>After the young had appeared, all the wit of
the bird came into play. I was on hand the next
day, I think. The mother bird sprang up when
I was within a pace of her, and in doing so
fanned the leaves with her wings till they sprang
up, too; as the leaves started the young started,
and as they were of the same color, to tell which
was the leaf and which the bird was a trying task
to any eye. I came the next day, when the same
tactics were repeated. Once a leaf fell upon one
of the young birds and nearly hid it. The young
are covered with a reddish down, like a young
partridge, and soon follow their mother about.
When disturbed, they gave but one leap, then
settled down, perfectly motionless and stupid,
with eyes closed. The parent bird, on these occasions,
made frantic efforts to decoy me away
from her young. She would fly a few paces and
fall upon her breast, and a spasm, like that of
death, would run through her tremulous outstretched
wings and prostrate body. She kept a
sharp eye out the mean while to see if the ruse
took, and, if it did not, she was quickly cured,
and, moving about to some other point, tried to
draw my attention as before. When followed
she always alighted upon the ground, dropping
down in a sudden, peculiar way. The second or
third day both old and young had disappeared.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>The whip-poor-will walks as awkwardly as a
swallow, which is as awkward as a man in a bag,
and yet she manages to lead her young about
the woods. The latter, I think, move by leaps
and sudden spurts, their protective coloring shielding
them most effectively.</p>

<hr class="tb1" />

<p>As the shadows deepen and the stars begin to
come out, the whip-poor-will suddenly strikes up.
What a rude intrusion upon the serenity and harmony
of the hour! A cry without music, insistent,
reiterated, loud, penetrating, and yet the ear
welcomes it; the night and the solitude are so
vast that they can stand it; and when, an hour
later, as the night enters into full possession, the
bird comes and serenades me under my window
or upon my doorstep, my heart warms toward it.
Its cry is a love-call, and there is something of
the ardor and persistence of love in it, and when
the female responds, and comes and hovers near,
there is an interchange of subdued, caressing
tones between the two birds that it is a delight
to hear. During my first summer in my cabin
one bird used to strike up every night from a
high ledge of rocks in front of my door. At just
such a moment in the twilight he would begin,
the first to break the stillness. Then the others
would follow, till the solitude was vocal with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
their calls. They are rarely heard later than ten
o'clock. Then at daybreak they take up the
tale again, whipping poor Will till one pities
him. One April morning between three and four
o'clock, hearing one strike up near my window,
I began counting its calls. My neighbor had told
me he had heard one call over two hundred times
without a break, which seemed to me a big story.
But I have a much bigger one to tell. This bird
actually laid upon the back of poor Will one
thousand and eighty-eight blows, with only a
barely perceptible pause here and there, as if to
catch its breath. Then it stopped about half
a minute and began again, uttering this time
three hundred and ninety calls, when it paused,
flew a little farther away, took up the tale once
more, and continued till I fell asleep.</p>

<p>By day the whip-poor-will apparently sits motionless
upon the ground. A few times in my
walks through the woods I have started one up
from almost under my feet. On such occasions
the bird's movements suggest those of a bat; its
wings make no noise, and it wavers about in
an uncertain manner, and quickly drops to the
ground again. One June day we flushed an old
one with her two young, but there was no indecision
or hesitation in the manner of the mother
bird this time. The young were more than half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
fledged, and they scampered away a few yards
and suddenly squatted upon the ground, where
their assimilative coloring rendered them almost
invisible. Then the anxious parent put forth all
her arts to absorb our attention and lure us away
from her offspring. She flitted before us from
side to side, with spread wings and tail, now falling
upon the ground, where she would remain a
moment as if quite disabled, then perching upon
an old stump or low branch with drooping, quivering
wings, and imploring us by every gesture
to take her and spare her young. My companion
had his camera with him, but the bird would not
remain long enough in one position for him to
get her picture.</p>

<h2>THE BLACK-THROATED BLUE WARBLER<br />
<small>A SEARCH FOR A RARE NEST</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> set out in hopes of finding a rare nest,&mdash;the
nest of the black-throated blue-backed
warbler, which, it seemed, with one or two others,
was still wanting to make the history of our
warblers complete. The woods were extensive,
and full of deep, dark tangles, and looking for
any particular nest seemed about as hopeless a
task as searching for a needle in a haystack, as
the old saying is. Where to begin, and how?
But the principle is the same as in looking for a
hen's nest,&mdash;first find your bird, then watch its
movements.</p>

<p>The bird is in these woods, for I have seen
him scores of times, but whether he builds high or
low, on the ground or in the trees, is all unknown
to me. That is his song now,&mdash;"twe-twea-twe-e-e-a,"
with a peculiar summer languor and plaintiveness,
and issuing from the lower branches
and growths. Presently we&mdash;for I have been
joined by a companion&mdash;discover the bird, a
male, insecting in the top of a newly fallen hemlock.
The black, white, and blue of his uniform<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
are seen at a glance. His movements are quite
slow compared with some of the warblers. If he
will only betray the locality of that little domicile
where his plainly clad mate is evidently sitting,
it is all we will ask of him. But this he seems
in no wise disposed to do. Here and there, and
up and down, we follow him, often losing him,
and as often refinding him by his song; but the
clew to his nest, how shall we get it? Does he
never go home to see how things are getting on,
or to see if his presence is not needed, or to take
madam a morsel of food? No doubt he keeps
within earshot, and a cry of distress or alarm from
the mother bird would bring him to the spot in
an instant. Would that some evil fate would
make her cry, then! Presently he encounters a
rival. His feeding-ground infringes upon that of
another, and the two birds regard each other
threateningly. This is a good sign, for their
nests are evidently near.</p>

<p>Their battle-cry is a low, peculiar chirp, not
very fierce, but bantering and confident. They
quickly come to blows, but it is a very fantastic
battle, and, as it would seem, indulged in more
to satisfy their sense of honor than to hurt each
other, for neither party gets the better of the
other, and they separate a few paces and sing, and
squeak, and challenge each other in a very happy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
frame of mind. The gauntlet is no sooner thrown
down than it is again taken up by one or the
other, and in the course of fifteen or twenty
minutes they have three or four encounters, separating
a little, then provoked to return again
like two cocks, till finally they withdraw beyond
hearing of each other,&mdash;both, no doubt, claiming
the victory. But the secret of the nest is
still kept. Once I think I have it. I catch a
glimpse of a bird which looks like the female, and
near by, in a small hemlock about eight feet from
the ground, my eye detects a nest. But as I come
up under it, I can see daylight through it, and
that it is empty,&mdash;evidently only partly finished,
not lined or padded yet. Now if the bird will
only return and claim it, the point will be gained.
But we wait and watch in vain. The architect
has knocked off to-day, and we must come again,
or continue our search.</p>

<p>Despairing of finding either of the nests of
the two males, we pushed on through the woods
to try our luck elsewhere. Before long, just as
we were about to plunge down a hill into a dense,
swampy part of the woods, we discovered a pair
of the birds we were in quest of. They had food
in their beaks, and, as we paused, showed great
signs of alarm, indicating that the nest was in
the immediate vicinity. This was enough. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
would pause here and find this nest, anyhow. To
make a sure thing of it, we determined to watch
the parent birds till we had wrung from them
their secret. So we doggedly crouched down and
watched them, and they watched us. It was diamond
cut diamond. But as we felt constrained
in our movements, desiring, if possible, to keep
so quiet that the birds would, after a while, see
in us only two harmless stumps or prostrate logs,
we had much the worst of it. The mosquitoes
were quite taken with our quiet, and knew us
from logs and stumps in a moment. Neither were
the birds deceived, not even when we tried the
Indian's tactics, and plumed ourselves with green
branches. Ah, the suspicious creatures, how they
watched us with the food in their beaks, abstaining
for one whole hour from ministering to that
precious charge which otherwise would have been
visited every few moments! Quite near us they
would come at times, between us and the nest,
eying us so sharply. Then they would move off,
and apparently try to forget our presence. Was it
to deceive us, or to persuade himself and his mate
that there was no serious cause for alarm, that the
male would now and then strike up in full song
and move off to some distance through the trees?
But the mother bird did not allow herself to lose
sight of us at all, and both birds, after carrying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the food in their beaks a long time, would swallow
it themselves. Then they would obtain another
morsel and apparently approach very near
the nest, when their caution or prudence would
come to their aid, and they would swallow the
food and hasten away. I thought the young
birds would cry out, but not a syllable from them.
Yet this was, no doubt, what kept the parent
birds away from the nest. The clamor the young
would have set up on the approach of the old
with food would have exposed everything.</p>

<p>After a time I felt sure I knew within a few
feet where the nest was concealed. Indeed, I
thought I knew the identical bush. Then the
birds approached each other again and grew very
confidential about another locality some rods below.
This puzzled us, and, seeing the whole
afternoon might be spent in this manner and
the mystery unsolved, we determined to change
our tactics and institute a thorough search of the
locality. This procedure soon brought things to a
crisis, for, as my companion clambered over a log
by a little hemlock, a few yards from where we had
been sitting, with a cry of alarm out sprang the
young birds from their nest in the hemlock, and,
scampering and fluttering over the leaves, disappeared
in different directions. Instantly the parent
birds were on the scene in an agony of alarm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Their distress was pitiful. They threw themselves
on the ground at our very feet, and fluttered, and
cried, and trailed themselves before us, to draw us
away from the place, or distract our attention
from the helpless young. I shall not forget the
male bird, how bright he looked, how sharp the
contrast as he trailed his painted plumage there
on the dry leaves. Apparently he was seriously disabled.
He would start up as if exerting every muscle
to fly away, but no use; down he would come,
with a helpless, fluttering motion, before he had
gone two yards, and apparently you had only to go
and pick him up. But before you could pick him
up, he had recovered somewhat and flown a little
farther; and thus, if you were tempted to follow
him, you would soon find yourself some distance
from the scene of the nest, and both old and young
well out of your reach. The female bird was not
less solicitous, and practiced the same arts upon us
to decoy us away, but her dull plumage rendered
her less noticeable. The male was clad in holiday
attire, but his mate in an every-day working-garb.</p>

<p>The nest was built in the fork of a little hemlock,
about fifteen inches from the ground, and
was a thick, firm structure, composed of the finer
material of the woods, with a lining of very delicate
roots or rootlets. There were four young
birds and one addled egg.</p>

<h2>THE MARSH HAWK<br />
<small>A MARSH HAWK'S NEST, A YOUNG HAWK, AND A VISIT TO A QUAIL ON HER NEST</small></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Most</span> country boys, I fancy, know the marsh
hawk. It is he you see flying low over the fields,
beating about bushes and marshes and dipping
over the fences, with his attention directed to
the ground beneath him. He is a cat on wings.
He keeps so low that the birds and mice do not
see him till he is fairly upon them. The hen-hawk
swoops down upon the meadow-mouse from his
position high in air, or from the top of a dead
tree; but the marsh hawk stalks him and comes
suddenly upon him from over the fence, or from
behind a low bush or tuft of grass. He is nearly
as large as the hen-hawk, but has a much longer
tail. When I was a boy I used to call him the
long-tailed hawk. The male is of a bluish slate-color;
the female reddish-brown, like the hen-hawk,
with a white rump.</p>

<p>Unlike the other hawks, they nest on the
ground in low, thick marshy places. For several
seasons a pair have nested in a bushy marsh a
few miles back of me, near the house of a farmer
friend of mine, who has a keen eye for the wild<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
life about him. Two years ago he found the
nest, but when I got over to see it the next week,
it had been robbed, probably by some boys in the
neighborhood. The past season, in April or May,
by watching the mother bird, he found the nest
again. It was in a marshy place, several acres in
extent, in the bottom of a valley, and thickly
grown with hardback, prickly ash, smilax, and
other low thorny bushes. My friend took me to
the brink of a low hill, and pointed out to me
in the marsh below us, as nearly as he could,
just where the nest was located. Then we crossed
the pasture, entered upon the marsh, and made
our way cautiously toward it. The wild, thorny
growths, waist-high, had to be carefully dealt
with. As we neared the spot, I used my eyes the
best I could, but I did not see the hawk till she
sprang into the air not ten yards away from us.
She went screaming upward, and was soon sailing
in a circle far above us. There, on a coarse
matting of twigs and weeds, lay five snow-white
eggs, a little more than half as large as hens'
eggs. My companion said the male hawk would
probably soon appear and join the female, but
he did not. She kept drifting away to the east,
and was soon gone from our sight.</p>

<p>We presently withdrew and secreted ourselves
behind the stone wall, in hopes of seeing the mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
hawk return. She appeared in the distance,
but seemed to know she was being watched, and
kept away.</p>

<p>About ten days later we made another visit to
the nest. An adventurous young Chicago lady
also wanted to see a hawk's nest, and so accompanied
us. This time three of the eggs were
hatched, and as the mother hawk sprang up,
either by accident or intentionally she threw
two of the young hawks some feet from the nest.
She rose up and screamed angrily. Then, turning
toward us, she came like an arrow straight at
the young lady, a bright plume in whose hat
probably drew her fire. The damsel gathered up
her skirts about her and beat a hasty retreat.
Hawks were not so pretty as she thought they
were. A large hawk launched at one's face from
high in the air is calculated to make one a little
nervous. It is such a fearful incline down which
the bird comes, and she is aiming exactly toward
your eye. When within about thirty feet of you,
she turns upward with a rushing sound, and,
mounting higher, falls toward you again. She is
only firing blank cartridges, as it were; but it
usually has the desired effect, and beats the
enemy off.</p>

<p>After we had inspected the young hawks, a
neighbor of my friend offered to conduct us to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
quail's nest. Anything in the shape of a nest is
always welcome, it is such a mystery, such a centre
of interest and affection, and, if upon the
ground, is usually something so dainty and exquisite
amid the natural wreckage and confusion.
A ground nest seems so exposed, too, that it always
gives a little thrill of pleasurable surprise
to see the group of frail eggs resting there behind
so slight a barrier. I will walk a long distance
any day just to see a song sparrow's nest
amid the stubble or under a tuft of grass. It is
a jewel in a rosette of jewels, with a frill of
weeds or turf. A quail's nest I had never seen,
and to be shown one within the hunting-ground
of this murderous hawk would be a double pleasure.
Such a quiet, secluded, grass-grown highway
as we moved along was itself a rare treat.
Sequestered was the word that the little valley
suggested, and peace the feeling the road evoked.
The farmer, whose fields lay about us, half grown
with weeds and bushes, evidently did not make
stir or noise enough to disturb anything. Beside
this rustic highway, bounded by old mossy
stone walls, and within a stone's throw of the
farmer's barn, the quail had made her nest. It
was just under the edge of a prostrate thorn-bush.</p>

<p>"The nest is right there," said the farmer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
pausing within ten feet of it, and pointing to the
spot with his stick.</p>

<p>In a moment or two we could make out the
mottled brown plumage of the sitting bird. Then
we approached her cautiously till we bent above
her.</p>

<p>She never moved a feather.</p>

<p>Then I put my cane down in the brush behind
her. We wanted to see the eggs, yet did
not want rudely to disturb the sitting hen.</p>

<p>She would not move.</p>

<p>Then I put down my hand within a few inches
of her; still she kept her place. Should we have
to lift her off bodily?</p>

<p>Then the young lady put down her hand, probably
the prettiest and the whitest hand the quail
had ever seen. At least it started her, and off
she sprang, uncovering such a crowded nest of
eggs as I had never before beheld. Twenty-one
of them! a ring or disk of white like a china tea-saucer.
You could not help saying, How pretty!
How cunning! like baby hens' eggs, as if the bird
were playing at sitting, as children play at housekeeping.</p>

<p>If I had known how crowded her nest was, I
should not have dared disturb her, for fear she
would break some of them. But not an egg suffered
harm by her sudden flight. And no harm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
came to the nest afterward. Every egg hatched,
I was told, and the little chicks, hardly bigger
than bumblebees, were led away by the mother
into the fields.</p>

<p>In about a week I paid another visit to the
hawk's nest. The eggs were all hatched, and the
mother bird was hovering near. I shall never
forget the curious expression of those young
hawks sitting there on the ground. The expression
was not one of youth, but of extreme age.
Such an ancient, infirm look as they had,&mdash;the
sharp, dark, and shrunken look about the face
and eyes, and their feeble, tottering motions!
They sat upon their elbows and the hind part of
their bodies, and their pale, withered legs and
feet extended before them in the most helpless
fashion. Their angular bodies were covered with
a pale yellowish down, like that of a chicken;
their heads had a plucked, seedy appearance;
and their long, strong, naked wings hung down
by their sides till they touched the ground:
power and ferocity in the first rude draught,
shorn of everything but its sinister ugliness. Another
curious thing was the gradation of the
young in size; they tapered down regularly from
the first to the fifth, as if there had been, as probably
there was, an interval of a day or two between
the hatchings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>The two older ones showed some signs of fear
on our approach, and one of them threw himself
upon his back, and put up his impotent legs, and
glared at us with open beak. The two smaller
ones regarded us not at all. Neither of the parent
birds appeared during our stay.</p>

<p>When I visited the nest again, eight or ten
days later, the birds were much grown, but of as
marked a difference in size as before, and with
the same look of extreme old age,&mdash;old age in
men of the aquiline type, nose and chin coming
together, and eyes large and sunken. They now
glared upon us with a wild, savage look, and
opened their beaks threateningly.</p>

<p>The next week, when my friend visited the
nest, the larger of the hawks fought him savagely.
But one of the brood, probably the last
to hatch, had made but little growth. It appeared
to be on the point of starvation. The mother
hawk (for the male seemed to have disappeared)
had perhaps found her family too large for her,
and was deliberately allowing one of the number
to perish; or did the larger and stronger young
devour all the food before the weaker member
could obtain any? Probably this was the case.</p>

<p>Arthur brought the feeble nestling away, and
the same day my little boy got it and brought it
home, wrapped in a woolen rag. It was clearly a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
starved bantling. It cried feebly but would not
lift up its head.</p>

<p>We first poured some warm milk down its
throat, which soon revived it, so that it would
swallow small bits of flesh. In a day or two we
had it eating ravenously, and its growth became
noticeable. Its voice had the sharp whistling
character of that of its parents, and was stilled
only when the bird was asleep. We made a pen
for it, about a yard square, in one end of the study,
covering the floor with several thicknesses of
newspapers; and here, upon a bit of brown woolen
blanket for a nest, the hawk waxed strong day by
day. An uglier-looking pet, tested by all the rules
we usually apply to such things, would have been
hard to find. There he would sit upon his elbows,
his helpless feet out in front of him, his great featherless
wings touching the floor, and shrilly cry
for more food. For a time we gave him water daily
from a stylograph-pen filler, but the water he
evidently did not need or relish. Fresh meat, and
plenty of it, was his demand. And we soon discovered
that he liked game, such as mice, squirrels,
birds, much better than butcher's meat.</p>

<p>Then began a lively campaign on the part of
my little boy against all the vermin and small
game in the neighborhood, to keep the hawk supplied.
He trapped and he hunted, he enlisted his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
mates in his service, he even robbed the cats to
feed the hawk. His usefulness as a boy of all
work was seriously impaired. "Where is J&mdash;&mdash;?"
"Gone after a squirrel for his hawk." And
often the day would be half gone before his hunt
was successful. The premises were very soon
cleared of mice, and the vicinity of chipmunks and
squirrels. Farther and farther he was compelled
to hunt the surrounding farms and woods to keep
up with the demands of the hawk. By the time
the hawk was ready to fly, it had consumed
twenty-one chipmunks, fourteen red squirrels,
sixteen mice, and twelve English sparrows, besides
a great deal of butcher's meat.</p>

<p>His plumage very soon began to show itself,
crowding off tufts of the down. The quills on his
great wings sprouted and grew apace. What a
ragged, uncanny appearance he presented! but
his look of extreme age gradually became modified.
What a lover of the sunlight he was! We
would put him out upon the grass in the full blaze
of the morning sun, and he would spread his wings
and bask in it with the most intense enjoyment.
In the nest the young must be exposed to the
full power of the midday sun during our first
heated terms in June and July, the thermometer
often going up to ninety-three or ninety-five degrees,
so that sunshine seemed to be a need of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
his nature. He liked the rain equally well, and
when put out in a shower would sit down and
take it as if every drop did him good.</p>

<p>His legs developed nearly as slowly as his
wings. He could not stand steadily upon them
till about ten days before he was ready to fly.
The talons were limp and feeble. When we came
with food, he would hobble along toward us like
the worst kind of a cripple, drooping and moving
his wings, and treading upon his legs from
the foot back to the elbow, the foot remaining
closed and useless. Like a baby learning to stand,
he made many trials before he succeeded. He
would rise up on his trembling legs only to fall
back again.</p>

<p>One day, in the summer-house, I saw him for
the first time stand for a moment squarely upon
his legs with the feet fully spread beneath them.
He looked about him as if the world suddenly
wore a new aspect.</p>

<p>His plumage now grew quite rapidly. One red
squirrel a day, chopped fine with an axe, was
his ration. He began to hold his game with his
foot while he tore it. The study was full of
his shed down. His dark-brown mottled plumage
began to grow beautiful. The wings drooped a
little, but gradually he got control of them, and
held them in place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>It was now the 20th of July, and the hawk
was about five weeks old. In a day or two he was
walking or jumping about the grounds. He chose
a position under the edge of a Norway spruce,
where he would sit for hours dozing, or looking
out upon the landscape. When we brought him
game, he would advance to meet us with wings
slightly lifted, and uttering a shrill cry. Toss him
a mouse or sparrow, and he would seize it with
one foot and hop off to his cover, where he
would bend above it, spread his plumage, look
this way and that, uttering all the time the most
exultant and satisfied chuckle.</p>

<p>About this time he began to practice striking
with his talons, as an Indian boy might begin
practicing with his bow and arrow. He would
strike at a dry leaf in the grass, or at a fallen
apple, or at some imaginary object. He was learning
the use of his weapons. His wings also,&mdash;he
seemed to feel them sprouting from his
shoulders. He would lift them straight up and
hold them expanded, and they would seem to
quiver with excitement. Every hour in the day
he would do this. The pressure was beginning to
centre there. Then he would strike playfully at
a leaf or a bit of wood, and keep his wings
lifted.</p>

<p>The next step was to spring into the air and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
beat his wings. He seemed now to be thinking
entirely of his wings. They itched to be put to
use.</p>

<p>A day or two later he would leap and fly several
feet. A pile of brush ten or twelve feet below
the bank was easily reached. Here he would
perch in true hawk fashion, to the bewilderment
and scandal of all the robins and catbirds in the
vicinity. Here he would dart his eye in all directions,
turning his head over and glancing up into
the sky.</p>

<p>He was now a lovely creature, fully fledged,
and as tame as a kitten. But he was not a bit like a
kitten in one respect,&mdash;he could not bear to have
you stroke or even touch his plumage. He had a
horror of your hand, as if it would hopelessly defile
him. But he would perch upon it, and allow you
to carry him about. If a dog or cat appeared, he
was ready to give battle instantly. He rushed
up to a little dog one day, and struck him with
his foot savagely. He was afraid of strangers,
and of any unusual object.</p>

<p>The last week in July he began to fly quite
freely, and it was necessary to clip one of his
wings. As the clipping embraced only the ends
of his primaries, he soon overcame the difficulty,
and, by carrying his broad, long tail more on that
side, flew with considerable ease. He made longer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and longer excursions into the surrounding fields
and vineyards, and did not always return. On such
occasions we would go to find him and fetch him
back.</p>

<p>Late one rainy afternoon he flew away into the
vineyard, and when, an hour later, I went after
him, he could not be found, and we never saw him
again. We hoped hunger would soon drive him
back, but we have had no clew to him from that
day to this.</p>

<h2>THE WINTER WREN</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> old hemlock wood at the head waters of
the Delaware is a chosen haunt of the winter
wren. His voice fills these dim aisles, as if aided
by some marvelous sounding-board. Indeed, his
song is very strong for so small a bird, and unites
in a remarkable degree brilliancy and plaintiveness.
I think of a tremulous, vibrating tongue
of silver. You may know it is the song of a wren
from its gushing, lyrical character; but you must
needs look sharp to see the little minstrel, especially
while in the act of singing. He is nearly the
color of the ground and the leaves; he never
ascends the tall trees, but keeps low, flitting
from stump to stump and from root to root, dodging
in and out of his hiding-places, and watching
all intruders with a suspicious eye. He has a very
pert, almost comical look. His tail stands more
than perpendicular: it points straight toward his
head. He is the least ostentatious singer I know
of. He does not strike an attitude, and lift up
his head in preparation, and, as it were, clear his
throat; but sits there on a log and pours out his
music, looking straight before him, or even down
at the ground. As a songster, he has but few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
superiors. I do not hear him after the first week
in July.</p>

<p>The winter wren is so called because he sometimes
braves our northern winters, but it is rarely
that one sees him at this season. I think I have seen
him only two or three times in winter in my life.
The event of one long walk, recently, in February,
was seeing one of these birds. As I followed a
byroad, beside a little creek in the edge of a wood,
my eye caught a glimpse of a small brown bird
darting under a stone bridge. I thought to myself
no bird but a wren would take refuge under
so small a bridge as that. I stepped down upon
it and expected to see the bird dart out at the
upper end. As it did not appear, I scrutinized
the bank of the little run, covered with logs and
brush, a few rods farther up.</p>

<p>Presently I saw the wren curtsying and gesticulating
beneath an old log. As I approached
he disappeared beneath some loose stones in the
bank, then came out again and took another peep
at me, then fidgeted about for a moment and disappeared
again, running in and out of the holes
and recesses and beneath the rubbish like a mouse
or a chipmunk. The winter wren may always be
known by these squatting, bobbing-out-and-in
habits.</p>

<p>As I sought a still closer view of him, he flitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
stealthily a few yards up the run and disappeared
beneath a small plank bridge near a
house.</p>

<p>I wondered what he could feed upon at such
a time. There was a light skim of snow upon the
ground, and the weather was cold. The wren, so
far as I know, is entirely an insect-feeder, and
where can he find insects in midwinter in our
climate? Probably by searching under bridges,
under brush-heaps, in holes and cavities in banks
where the sun falls warm. In such places he may
find dormant spiders and flies and other hibernating
insects or their larv&aelig;. We have a tiny,
mosquito-like creature that comes forth in March
or in midwinter, as soon as the temperature is a
little above freezing. One may see them performing
their fantastic air-dances when the air is
so chilly that one buttons his overcoat about him
in his walk. They are darker than the mosquito,&mdash;a
sort of dark water-color,&mdash;and are very
frail to the touch. Maybe the wren knows the
hiding-place of these insects.</p>

<h2>THE CEDAR-BIRD</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> alert and vigilant the birds are, even when
absorbed in building their nests! In an open
space in the woods I see a pair of cedar-birds
collecting moss from the top of a dead tree. Following
the direction in which they fly, I soon
discover the nest placed in the fork of a small
soft maple, which stands amid a thick growth of
wild cherry-trees and young beeches. Carefully
concealing myself beneath it, without any fear
that the workmen will hit me with a chip or let
fall a tool, I await the return of the busy pair.
Presently I hear the well-known note, and the
female sweeps down and settles unsuspectingly
into the half-finished structure. Hardly have her
wings rested before her eye has penetrated my
screen, and with a hurried movement of alarm
she darts away. In a moment the male, with a
tuft of wool in his beak (for there is a sheep pasture
near), joins her, and the two reconnoitre
the premises from the surrounding bushes. With
their beaks still loaded, they flit round with a
frightened look, and refuse to approach the
nest till I have moved off and lain down behind
a log. Then one of them ventures to alight upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the nest, but, still suspecting all is not right,
quickly darts away again. Then they both together
come, and after much peeping and spying
about, and apparently much anxious consultation,
cautiously proceed to work. In less than
half an hour it would seem that wool enough
has been brought to supply the whole family,
real and prospective, with socks, if needles and
fingers could be found fine enough to knit it up.
In less than a week the female has begun to deposit
her eggs,&mdash;four of them in as many days,&mdash;white
tinged with purple, with black spots on
the larger end. After two weeks of incubation
the young are out.</p>

<p>Excepting the American goldfinch, this bird
builds later in the season than any other, its
nest, in our northern climate, seldom being undertaken
till July. As with the goldfinch, the
reason is, probably, that suitable food for the
young cannot be had at an earlier period.</p>

<p>I knew a pair of cedar-birds, one season, to
build in an apple-tree, the branches of which
rubbed against the house. For a day or two before
the first straw was laid, I noticed the pair
carefully exploring every branch of the tree, the
female taking the lead, the male following her
with an anxious note and look. It was evident
that the wife was to have her choice this time;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
and, like one who thoroughly knew her mind, she
was proceeding to take it. Finally the site was
chosen upon a high branch, extending over one
low wing of the house. Mutual congratulations
and caresses followed, when both birds flew away
in quest of building-material. That most freely
used is a sort of cotton-bearing plant which grows
in old worn-out fields. The nest is large for the
size of the bird, and very soft. It is in every respect
a first-class domicile.</p>

<p>The cedar-bird is the most silent bird we have.
Our neutral-tinted birds, like him, as a rule are
our finest songsters; but he has no song or call,
uttering only a fine bead-like note on taking
flight. This note is the cedar-berry rendered back
in sound. When the ox-heart cherries, which he
has only recently become acquainted with, have
had time to enlarge his pipe and warm his heart,
I shall expect more music from him. But in lieu
of music, what a pretty compensation are those
minute, almost artificial-like, plumes of orange
and vermilion that tip the ends of his wing quills!
Nature could not give him these and a song too.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE GOLDFINCH</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> the most noticeable bird of August in
New York and New England is the yellowbird,
or goldfinch. This is one of the last birds to nest,
seldom hatching its eggs till late in July. It seems
as if a particular kind of food were required to
rear its brood, which cannot be had at an earlier
date. The seed of the common thistle is apparently
its mainstay. There is no prettier sight at
this season than a troop of young goldfinches,
led by their parents, going from thistle to thistle
along the roadside and pulling the ripe heads to
pieces for the seed. The plaintive call of the
young is one of the characteristic August sounds.
Their nests are frequently destroyed, or the eggs
thrown from them, by the terrific July thunder-showers.
Last season a pair had a nest on the
slender branch of a maple in front of the door
of the house where I was staying. The eggs
were being deposited, and the happy pair had a
loving conversation about them many times each
day, when one afternoon a very violent storm
arose which made the branches of the trees stream
out like wildly disheveled hair, quite turning over
those on the windward side, and emptying the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
pretty nest of its eggs. In such cases the birds
build anew,&mdash;a delay that may bring the incubation
into August.</p>

<p>It is a deep, snug, compact nest, with no loose
ends hanging, placed in the fork of a small limb
of an apple-tree, a peach-tree, or an ornamental
shade-tree. The eggs are faint bluish-white.</p>

<p>While the female is sitting, the male feeds her
regularly. She calls to him on his approach, or
when she hears his voice passing by, in the most
affectionate, feminine, childlike tones, the only
case I know where the sitting bird makes any
sound while in the act of incubation. When a
rival male invades the tree, or approaches too
near, the male whose nest it holds pursues and
reasons or expostulates with him in the same
bright, amicable, confiding tones. Indeed, most
birds make use of their sweetest notes in war.
The song of love is the song of battle too. The
male yellowbirds flit about from point to point,
apparently assuring each other of the highest
sentiments of esteem and consideration, at the
same time that one intimates to the other that
he is carrying his joke a little too far. It has the
effect of saying with mild and good-humored surprise,
"Why, my dear sir, this is my territory;
you surely do not mean to trespass; permit me
to salute you, and to escort you over the line."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
Yet the intruder does not always take the hint.
Occasionally the couple have a brief sparring-match
in the air, and mount up and up, beak to
beak, to a considerable height, but rarely do they
actually come to blows.</p>

<p>The yellowbird becomes active and conspicuous
after the other birds have nearly all withdrawn
from the stage and become silent, their
broods reared and flown. August is his month,
his festive season. It is his turn now. The thistles
are ripening their seeds, and his nest is undisturbed
by jay-bird or crow. He is the first bird
I hear in the morning, circling and swinging
through the air in that peculiar undulating flight,
and calling out on the downward curve of each
stroke, "Here we go, here we go!" Every hour
in the day he indulges in his circling, billowy
flight. It is a part of his musical performance.
His course at such times is a deeply undulating
line, like the long, gentle roll of the summer sea,
the distance from crest to crest or from valley to
valley being probably thirty feet; this distance
is made with but one brief beating of the wings
on the downward curve. As he quickly opens
them, they give him a strong upward impulse,
and he describes the long arc with them closely
folded. Thus, falling and recovering, rising and
sinking like dolphins in the sea, he courses through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the summer air. In marked contrast to this feat
is his manner of flying when he indulges in a
brief outburst of song on the wing. Now he flies
level, with broad expanded wings nearly as round
and as concave as two shells, which beat the
air slowly. The song is the chief matter now,
and the wings are used only to keep him afloat
while delivering it. In the other case, the flight
is the main concern, and the voice merely punctuates
it.</p>

<hr class="tb1" />

<p>Among our familiar birds the matchmaking
of none other is quite so pretty as that of the
goldfinch. The goldfinches stay with us in loose
flocks and clad in a dull-olive suit throughout
the winter. In May the males begin to put on
their bright summer plumage. This is the result
of a kind of superficial moulting. Their feathers
are not shed, but their dusky covering or overalls
are cast off. When the process is only partly
completed, the bird has a smutty, unpresentable
appearance. But we seldom see them at such
times. They seem to retire from society. When
the change is complete, and the males have got
their bright uniforms of yellow and black, the
courting begins. All the goldfinches of a neighborhood
collect together and hold a sort of musical
festival. To the number of many dozens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
they may be seen in some large tree, all singing
and calling in the most joyous and vivacious manner.
The males sing, and the females chirp and
call. Whether there is actual competition on a
trial of musical abilities of the males before the
females or not, I do not know. The best of feeling
seems to pervade the company; there is no
sign of quarreling or fighting; "all goes merry
as a marriage bell," and the matches seem actually
to be made during these musical picnics.
Before May is passed the birds are seen in
couples, and in June housekeeping usually begins.
This I call the ideal of love-making among
birds, and is in striking contrast to the squabbles
and jealousies of most of our songsters.</p>

<p>I have known the goldfinches to keep up this
musical and love-making festival through three
consecutive days of a cold northeast rainstorm.
Bedraggled, but ardent and happy, the birds were
not to be dispersed by wind or weather.</p>

<h2>THE HEN-HAWK<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">August</span> is the month of the high-sailing hawks.
The hen-hawk is the most noticeable. He likes
the haze and calm of these long, warm days. He
is a bird of leisure, and seems always at his ease.
How beautiful and majestic are his movements!
So self-poised and easy, such an entire absence
of haste, such a magnificent amplitude of circles
and spirals, such a haughty, imperial grace, and,
occasionally, such daring aerial evolutions!</p>

<p>With slow, leisurely movement, rarely vibrating
his pinions, he mounts and mounts in an ascending
spiral till he appears a mere speck against
the summer sky; then, if the mood seizes him,
with wings half closed, like a bent bow, he will
cleave the air almost perpendicularly, as if intent
on dashing himself to pieces against the earth;
but on nearing the ground he suddenly mounts
again on broad, expanded wing, as if rebounding
upon the air, and sails leisurely away. It is the
sublimest feat of the season. One holds his breath
till he sees him rise again.</p>

<p>If inclined to a more gradual and less precipitous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
descent, he fixes his eye on some distant
point in the earth beneath him, and thither bends
his course. He is still almost meteoric in his speed
and boldness. You see his path down the heavens,
straight as a line; if near, you hear the rush
of his wings; his shadow hurtles across the fields,
and in an instant you see him quietly perched
upon some low tree or decayed stub in a swamp
or meadow, with reminiscences of frogs and mice
stirring in his maw.</p>

<p>When the south wind blows, it is a study to
see three or four of these air-kings at the head
of the valley far up toward the mountain, balancing
and oscillating upon the strong current;
now quite stationary, except for a slight tremulous
motion like the poise of a rope-dancer, then rising
and falling in long undulations, and seeming
to resign themselves passively to the wind;
or, again, sailing high and level far above the
mountain's peak, no bluster and haste, but, as
stated, occasionally a terrible earnestness and
speed. Fire at one as he sails overhead, and, unless
wounded badly, he will not change his course
or gait.</p>

<p>The calmness and dignity of this hawk, when
attacked by crows or the kingbird, are well worthy
of him. He seldom deigns to notice his noisy
and furious antagonists, but deliberately wheels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
about in that aerial spiral, and mounts and mounts
till his pursuers grow dizzy and return to earth
again. It is quite original, this mode of getting
rid of an unworthy opponent,&mdash;rising to heights
where the braggart is dazed and bewildered and
loses his reckoning! I am not sure but it is worthy
of imitation.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The red-tailed and red-shouldered hawks are both called
hen-hawks.</p></div>

<h2>THE RUFFED GROUSE, OR PARTRIDGE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Whir! whir! whir!</span> and a brood of half-grown
partridges start up like an explosion, a few paces
from me, and, scattering, disappear into the bushes
on all sides. Let me sit down here behind the
screen of ferns and briers, and hear this wild
hen of the woods call together her brood. At
what an early age the partridge flies! Nature
seems to concentrate her energies on the wing,
making the safety of the bird a point to be
looked after first; and while the body is covered
with down, and no signs of feathers are visible
there, the wing-quills sprout and unfold, and in
an incredibly short time the young make fair
headway in flying.</p>

<p>Hark! there arises over there in the brush a
soft, persuasive cooing, a sound so subtle and
wild and unobtrusive that it requires the most
alert and watchful ear to hear it. How gentle
and solicitous and full of yearning love! It is
the voice of the mother hen. Presently a faint
timid "Yeap!" which almost eludes the ear, is
heard in various directions,&mdash;the young responding.
As no danger seems near, the cooing of the
parent bird is soon a very audible clucking call,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and the young move cautiously in that direction.
Let me step never so carefully from my hiding-place,
and all sounds instantly cease, and I
search in vain for either parent or young.</p>

<p>The partridge is one of our native and most
characteristic birds. The woods seem good to be
in where I find him. He gives a habitable air to
the forest, and one feels as if the rightful occupant
were really at home. The woods where I
do not find him seem to want something, as if
suffering from some neglect of Nature. And
then he is such a splendid success, so hardy and
vigorous. I think he enjoys the cold and the
snow. His wings seem to rustle with more fervency
in midwinter. If the snow falls very fast,
and promises a heavy storm, he will complacently
sit down and allow himself to be snowed under.
When you approach him at such times, he suddenly
bursts out of the snow at your feet, scattering
the flakes in all directions, and goes
humming away through the woods like a bomb-shell,&mdash;a
picture of native spirit and success.</p>

<p>His drum is one of the most welcome and
beautiful sounds of spring. Scarcely have the
trees expanded their buds, when, in the still April
mornings, or toward nightfall, you hear the hum
of his devoted wings. He selects, not, as you
would predict, a dry and resinous log, but a decayed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and crumbling one, seeming to give the
preference to old oak-logs that are partly blended
with the soil. If a log to his taste cannot be
found, he sets up his altar on a rock, which becomes
resonant beneath his fervent blows. Who
has seen the partridge drum? It is the next
thing to catching a weasel asleep, though by
much caution and tact it may be done. He does
not hug the log, but stands very erect, expands
his ruff, gives two introductory blows, pauses
half a second, and then resumes, striking faster
and faster till the sound becomes a continuous,
unbroken whir, the whole lasting less than half
a minute. The tips of his wings barely brush the
log, so that the sound is produced rather by the
force of the blows upon the air and upon his
own body as in flying. One log will be used for
many years, though not by the same drummer.
It seems to be a sort of temple and held in great
respect. The bird always approaches on foot,
and leaves it in the same quiet manner, unless
rudely disturbed. He is very cunning, though his
wit is not profound. It is difficult to approach
him by stealth; you will try many times before
succeeding; but seem to pass by him in a great
hurry, making all the noise possible, and with
plumage furled he stands as immovable as a knot,
allowing you a good view.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>The sharp-rayed track of the partridge adds
another figure to the fantastic embroidery upon
the winter snow. Her course is a clear, strong
line, sometimes quite wayward, but generally very
direct, steering for the densest, most impenetrable
places,&mdash;leading you over logs and through
brush, alert and expectant, till, suddenly, she
bursts up a few yards from you, and goes humming
through the trees,&mdash;the complete triumph
of endurance and vigor. Hardy native bird, may
your tracks never be fewer, or your visits to the
birch-tree less frequent!</p>

<h2>THE CROW</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> crow may not have the sweet voice which
the fox in his flattery attributed to him, but he
has a good, strong, native speech nevertheless.
How much character there is in it! How much
thrift and independence! Of course his plumage
is firm, his color decided, his wit quick. He understands
you at once and tells you so; so does
the hawk by his scornful, defiant <i>whir-r-r-r-r</i>.
Hardy, happy outlaws, the crows, how I love
them! Alert, social, republican, always able to
look out for himself, not afraid of the cold and
the snow, fishing when flesh is scarce, and stealing
when other resources fail, the crow is a
character I would not willingly miss from the
landscape. I love to see his track in the snow or
the mud, and his graceful pedestrianism about
the brown fields.</p>

<p>He is no interloper, but has the air and manner
of being thoroughly at home, and in rightful
possession of the land. He is no sentimentalist
like some of the plaining, disconsolate song-birds,
but apparently is always in good health
and good spirits. No matter who is sick, or dejected,
or unsatisfied, or what the weather is, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
what the price of corn, the crow is well and finds
life sweet. He is the dusky embodiment of
worldly wisdom and prudence. Then he is one
of Nature's self-appointed constables and greatly
magnifies his office. He would fain arrest every
hawk or owl or grimalkin that ventures abroad.
I have known a posse of them to beset the fox
and cry "Thief!" till Reynard hid himself for
shame. Do I say the fox flattered the crow when
he told him he had a sweet voice? Yet one of
the most musical sounds in nature proceeds from
the crow. All the crow tribe, from the blue jay
up, are capable of certain low ventriloquial notes
that have peculiar cadence and charm. I often
hear the crow indulging in his in winter, and am
reminded of the sound of the dulcimer. The bird
stretches up and exerts himself like a cock in the
act of crowing, and gives forth a peculiarly clear,
vitreous sound that is sure to arrest and reward
your attention. This is, no doubt, the song the
fox begged to be favored with, as in delivering
it the crow must inevitably let drop the piece of
meat.</p>

<p>The crow has fine manners. He always has
the walk and air of a lord of the soil. One morning
I put out some fresh meat upon the snow
near my study window. Presently a crow came
and carried it off, and alighted with it upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
ground in the vineyard. While he was eating it,
another crow came, and, alighting a few yards
away, slowly walked up to within a few feet of
this fellow and stopped. I expected to see a
struggle over the food, as would have been the
case with domestic fowls or animals. Nothing of
the kind. The feeding crow stopped eating, regarded
the other for a moment, made a gesture
or two, and flew away. Then the second crow
went up to the food, and proceeded to take his
share. Presently the first crow came back, when
each seized a portion of the food and flew away
with it. Their mutual respect and good-will
seemed perfect. Whether it really was so in our
human sense, or whether it was simply an illustration
of the instinct of mutual support which
seems to prevail among gregarious birds, I know
not. Birds that are solitary in their habits, like
hawks or woodpeckers, behave quite differently
toward each other in the presence of their food.</p>

<p>The crow will quickly discover anything that
looks like a trap or snare set to catch him, but it
takes him a long time to see through the simplest
contrivance. As I have above stated, I sometimes
place meat on the snow in front of my study
window to attract him. On one occasion, after a
couple of crows had come to expect something
there daily, I suspended a piece of meat by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
string from a branch of the tree just over the
spot where I usually placed the food. A crow
soon discovered it, and came into the tree to
see what it meant. His suspicions were aroused.
There was some design in that suspended meat,
evidently. It was a trap to catch him. He surveyed
it from every near branch. He peeked and
pried, and was bent on penetrating the mystery.
He flew to the ground, and walked about and
surveyed it from all sides. Then he took a long
walk down about the vineyard as if in hope of
hitting upon some clew. Then he came to the
tree again, and tried first one eye, then the other,
upon it; then to the ground beneath; then he
went away and came back; then his fellow came,
and they both squinted and investigated, and
then disappeared. Chickadees and woodpeckers
would alight upon the meat and peck it swinging
in the wind, but the crows were fearful. Does
this show reflection? Perhaps it does, but I look
upon it rather as that instinct of fear and cunning
so characteristic of the crow. Two days
passed thus: every morning the crows came and
surveyed the suspended meat from all points in
the tree, and then went away. The third day I
placed a large bone on the snow beneath the suspended
morsel. Presently one of the crows appeared
in the tree, and bent his eye upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
tempting bone. "The mystery deepens," he
seemed to say to himself. But after half an hour's
investigation, and after approaching several times
within a few feet of the food upon the ground,
he seemed to conclude there was no connection
between it and the piece hanging by the string.
So he finally walked up to it and fell to pecking
it, flickering his wings all the time, as a sign of
his watchfulness. He also turned up his eye,
momentarily, to the piece in the air above, as if
it might be some disguised sword of Damocles
ready to fall upon him. Soon his mate came and
alighted on a low branch of the tree. The feeding
crow regarded him a moment, and then flew
up to his side, as if to give him a turn at the
meat. But he refused to run the risk. He evidently
looked upon the whole thing as a delusion
and a snare, and presently went away, and his
mate followed him. Then I placed the bone in
one of the main forks of the tree, but the crows
kept at a safe distance from it. Then I put it
back to the ground, but they grew more and
more suspicious; some evil intent in it all, they
thought. Finally a dog carried off the bone, and
the crows ceased to visit the tree.</p>

<hr class="tb1" />

<p>From my boyhood I have seen the yearly meeting
of the crows in September or October, on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
high grassy hill or a wooded ridge. Apparently,
all the crows from a large area assemble at these
times; you may see them coming, singly or in
loose bands, from all directions to the rendezvous,
till there are hundreds of them together. They
make black an acre or two of ground. At intervals
they all rise in the air, and wheel about, all
cawing at once. Then to the ground again, or to
the tree-tops, as the case may be; then, rising
again, they send forth the voice of the multitude.
What does it all mean? I notice that this rally
is always preliminary to their going into winter
quarters. It would be interesting to know just
the nature of the communication that takes place
between them.</p>

<h2>THE NORTHERN SHRIKE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Usually</span> the character of a bird of prey is well
defined; there is no mistaking him. His claws,
his beak, his head, his wings, in fact his whole
build, point to the fact that he subsists upon live
creatures; he is armed to catch them and to slay
them. Every bird knows a hawk and knows him
from the start, and is on the lookout for him.
The hawk takes life, but he does it to maintain
his own, and it is a public and universally known
fact. Nature has sent him abroad in that character,
and has advised all creatures of it. Not so
with the shrike; here she has concealed the character
of a murderer under a form as innocent as
that of the robin. Feet, wings, tail, color, head,
and general form and size are all those of a song-bird,&mdash;very
much like that master songster, the
mockingbird,&mdash;yet this bird is a regular Bluebeard
among its kind. Its only characteristic
feature is its beak, the upper mandible having two
sharp processes and a sharp hooked point. It usually
impales its victim upon a thorn, or thrusts it
in the fork of a limb. For the most part, however,
its food seems to consist of insects,&mdash;spiders,
grasshoppers, beetles, etc. It is the assassin of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the small birds, whom it often destroys in pure
wantonness, or merely to sup on their brains, as
the Gaucho slaughters a wild cow or bull for its
tongue. It is a wolf in sheep's clothing. Apparently
its victims are unacquainted with its true
character and allow it to approach them, when
the fatal blow is given. I saw an illustration of
this the other day. A large number of goldfinches
in their fall plumage, together with snowbirds
and sparrows, were feeding and chattering
in some low bushes back of the barn. I had
paused by the fence and was peeping through at
them, hoping to get a glimpse of that rare sparrow,
the white-crowned. Presently I heard a rustling
among the dry leaves as if some larger bird
were also among them. Then I heard one of the
goldfinches cry out as if in distress, when the
whole flock of them started up in alarm, and,
circling around, settled in the tops of the larger
trees. I continued my scrutiny of the bushes,
when I saw a large bird, with some object in its
beak, hopping along on a low branch near the
ground. It disappeared from my sight for a few
moments, then came up through the undergrowth
into the top of a young maple where some of the
finches had alighted, and I beheld the shrike.
The little birds avoided him and flew about the
tree, their pursuer following them with the motions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
of his head and body as if he would fain
arrest them by his murderous gaze. The birds did
not utter the cry or make the demonstration of
alarm they usually do on the appearance of a
hawk, but chirruped and called and flew about
in a half wondering, half bewildered manner. As
they flew farther along the line of trees the
shrike followed them as if bent on further captures.
I then made my way around to see what the
shrike had caught, and what he had done with
his prey. As I approached the bushes I saw the
shrike hastening back. I read his intentions at
once. Seeing my movements, he had returned
for his game. But I was too quick for him, and
he got up out of the brush and flew away from
the locality. On some twigs in the thickest part
of the bushes I found his victim,&mdash;a goldfinch.
It was not impaled upon a thorn, but was carefully
disposed upon some horizontal twigs,&mdash;laid
upon the shelf, so to speak. It was as warm
as in life, and its plumage was unruffled. On examining
it I found a large bruise or break in the
skin on the back of the neck, at the base of the
skull. Here the bandit had no doubt gripped the
bird with his strong beak. The shrike's bloodthirstiness
was seen in the fact that he did not
stop to devour his prey, but went in quest of
more, as if opening a market of goldfinches. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
thicket was his shambles, and if not interrupted,
he might have had a fine display of titbits in a
short time.</p>

<p>The shrike is called a butcher from his habit
of sticking his meat upon hooks and points;
further than that, he is a butcher because he devours
but a trifle of what he slays.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE SCREECH OWL</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> one point in the grayest, most shaggy part
of the woods, I come suddenly upon a brood of
screech owls, full grown, sitting together upon a
dry, moss-draped limb, but a few feet from the
ground. I pause within four or five yards of them
and am looking about me, when my eye lights
upon these gray, motionless figures. They sit
perfectly upright, some with their backs and
some with their breasts toward me, but every
head turned squarely in my direction. Their eyes
are closed to a mere black line; through this
crack they are watching me, evidently thinking
themselves unobserved. The spectacle is weird
and grotesque, and suggests something impish
and uncanny. It is a new effect, the night side
of the woods by daylight. After observing them
a moment I take a single step toward them, when,
quick as thought, their eyes fly wide open, their
attitude is changed, they bend, some this way,
some that, and, instinct with life and motion,
stare wildly around them. Another step, and
they all take flight but one, which stoops low on
the branch, and with the look of a frightened
cat regards me for a few seconds over its shoulder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
They fly swiftly and softly, and disperse through
the trees.</p>

<hr class="tb1" />

<p>A winter neighbor of mine, in whom I am interested,
and who perhaps lends me his support
after his kind, is a little red owl, whose retreat
is in the heart of an old apple-tree just over the
fence. Where he keeps himself in spring and
summer, I do not know, but late every fall, and
at intervals all winter, his hiding-place is discovered
by the jays and nuthatches, and proclaimed
from the tree-tops for the space of half
an hour or so, with all the powers of voice they
can command. Four times during one winter
they called me out to behold this little ogre feigning
sleep in his den, sometimes in one apple-tree,
sometimes in another. Whenever I heard their
cries, I knew my neighbor was being berated.
The birds would take turns at looking in upon
him, and uttering their alarm-notes. Every jay
within hearing would come to the spot, and at
once approach the hole in the trunk or limb, and
with a kind of breathless eagerness and excitement
take a peep at the owl, and then join the
outcry. When I approached they would hastily
take a final look, and then withdraw and regard
my movements intently. After accustoming my
eye to the faint light of the cavity for a few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
moments, I could usually make out the owl at the
bottom feigning sleep. Feigning, I say, because
this is what he really did, as I first discovered
one day when I cut into his retreat with the axe.
The loud blows and the falling chips did not
disturb him at all. When I reached in a stick
and pulled him over on his side, leaving one of
his wings spread out, he made no attempt to recover
himself, but lay among the chips and fragments
of decayed wood, like a part of themselves.
Indeed, it took a sharp eye to distinguish him.
Not till I had pulled him forth by one wing,
rather rudely, did he abandon his trick of simulated
sleep or death. Then, like a detected pickpocket,
he was suddenly transformed into another
creature. His eyes flew wide open, his talons
clutched my finger, his ears were depressed, and
every motion and look said, "Hands off, at your
peril." Finding this game did not work, he soon
began to "play possum" again. I put a cover
over my study wood-box and kept him captive
for a week. Look in upon him at any time, night
or day, and he was apparently wrapped in the
profoundest slumber; but the live mice which I
put into his box from time to time found his
sleep was easily broken; there would be a sudden
rustle in the box, a faint squeak, and then silence.
After a week of captivity I gave him his freedom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
in the full sunshine; no trouble for him to see
which way and where to go.</p>

<p>Just at dusk in the winter nights, I often
hear his soft <i>bur-r-r-r</i>, very pleasing and bell-like.
What a furtive, woody sound it is in the winter
stillness, so unlike the harsh scream of the hawk!
But all the ways of the owl are ways of softness
and duskiness. His wings are shod with silence,
his plumage is edged with down.</p>

<p>Another owl neighbor of mine, with whom I
pass the time of day more frequently than with
the last, lives farther away. I pass his castle
every night on my way to the post-office, and in
winter, if the hour is late enough, am pretty
sure to see him standing in his doorway, surveying
the passers-by and the landscape through
narrow slits in his eyes. For four successive
winters now have I observed him. As the twilight
begins to deepen, he rises up out of his cavity
in the apple-tree, scarcely faster than the moon
rises from behind the hill, and sits in the opening,
completely framed by its outlines of gray
bark and dead wood, and by his protective coloring
virtually invisible to every eye that does
not know he is there. Probably my own is
the only eye that has ever penetrated his secret,
and mine never would have done so had I not
chanced on one occasion to see him leave his retreat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and make a raid upon a shrike that was
impaling a shrew-mouse upon a thorn in a neighboring
tree, and which I was watching. I was
first advised of the owl's presence by seeing him
approaching swiftly on silent, level wing. The
shrike did not see him till the owl was almost
within the branches. He then dropped his game,
and darted back into the thick cover, uttering a
loud, discordant squawk, as one would say, "Scat!
scat! scat!" The owl alighted, and was, perhaps,
looking about him for the shrike's impaled game,
when I drew near. On seeing me, he reversed
his movement precipitately, flew straight back to
the old tree, and alighted in the entrance to the
cavity. As I approached, he did not so much
seem to move as to diminish in size, like an object
dwindling in the distance; he depressed his plumage,
and, with his eye fixed upon me, began
slowly to back and sidle into his retreat till he
faded from my sight. The shrike wiped his beak
upon the branches, cast an eye down at me and
at his lost mouse, and then flew away.</p>

<p>A few nights afterward, as I passed that way,
I saw the little owl again sitting in his doorway,
waiting for the twilight to deepen, and undisturbed
by the passers-by; but when I paused to
observe him, he saw that he was discovered, and
he slunk back into his den as on the former occasion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Ever since, while going that way, I have
been on the lookout for him. Dozens of teams
and foot-passengers pass him late in the day,
but he regards them not, nor they him. When I
come along and pause to salute him, he opens
his eyes a little wider, and, appearing to recognize
me, quickly shrinks and fades into the background
of his door in a very weird and curious
manner. When he is not at his outlook, or
when he is, it requires the best powers of the
eye to decide the point, as the empty cavity itself
is almost an exact image of him. If the
whole thing had been carefully studied, it could
not have answered its purpose better. The owl
stands quite perpendicular, presenting a front of
light mottled gray; the eyes are closed to a
mere slit, the ear-feathers depressed, the beak
buried in the plumage, and the whole attitude is
one of silent, motionless waiting and observation.
If a mouse should be seen crossing the highway,
or scudding over any exposed part of the snowy
surface in the twilight, the owl would doubtless
swoop down upon it. I think the owl has learned
to distinguish me from the rest of the passers-by;
at least, when I stop before him, and he sees
himself observed, he backs down into his den, as
I have said, in a very amusing manner.</p>

<h2>THE CHICKADEE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> chickadees we have always with us. They
are like the evergreens among trees and plants.
Winter has no terrors for them. They are properly
wood-birds, but the groves and orchards
know them also. Did they come near my cabin
for better protection, or did they chance to find
a little cavity in a tree there that suited them?
Branch-builders and ground-builders are easily
accommodated, but the chickadee must find
a cavity, and a small one at that. The woodpeckers
make a cavity when a suitable trunk or
branch is found, but the chickadee, with its
small, sharp beak, rarely does so; it usually
smooths and deepens one already formed. This
a pair did a few yards from my cabin. The opening
was into the heart of a little sassafras, about
four feet from the ground. Day after day the
birds took turns in deepening and enlarging the
cavity: a soft, gentle hammering for a few moments
in the heart of the little tree, and then the
appearance of the worker at the opening, with
the chips in his, or her, beak. They changed off
every little while, one working while the other
gathered food. Absolute equality of the sexes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
both in plumage and in duties, seems to prevail
among these birds, as among a few other species.
During the preparations for housekeeping the
birds were hourly seen and heard, but as soon as
the first egg was laid, all this was changed.
They suddenly became very shy and quiet. Had
it not been for the new egg that was added each
day, one would have concluded that they had
abandoned the place. There was a precious secret
now that must be well kept. After incubation
began, it was only by watching that I could
get a glimpse of one of the birds as it came
quickly to feed or to relieve the other.</p>

<p>One day a lot of Vassar girls came to visit me,
and I led them out to the little sassafras to see
the chickadee's nest. The sitting bird kept her
place as head after head, with its nodding plumes
and millinery, appeared above the opening to
her chamber, and a pair of inquisitive eyes peered
down upon her. But I saw that she was getting
ready to play her little trick to frighten them
away. Presently I heard a faint explosion at the
bottom of the cavity, when the peeping girl
jerked her head quickly back, with the exclamation,
"Why, it spit at me!" The trick of the
bird on such occasions is apparently to draw in
its breath till its form perceptibly swells, and
then give forth a quick, explosive sound like an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
escaping jet of steam. One involuntarily closes
his eyes and jerks back his head. The girls, to
their great amusement, provoked the bird into
this pretty outburst of her impatience two or
three times. But as the ruse failed of its effect,
the bird did not keep it up, but let the laughing
faces gaze till they were satisfied.</p>

<p>I was much interested in seeing a brood of
chickadees, reared on my premises, venture upon
their first flight. Their heads had been seen at
the door of their dwelling&mdash;a cavity in the limb
of a pear-tree&mdash;at intervals for two or three
days. Evidently they liked the looks of the great
outside world; and one evening, just before sundown,
one of them came forth. His first flight
was of several yards, to a locust, where he alighted
upon an inner branch, and after some chirping
and calling proceeded to arrange his plumage
and compose himself for the night. I watched
him till it was nearly dark. He did not appear
at all afraid there alone in the tree, but put his
head under his wing and settled down for the
night as if it were just what he had always
been doing. There was a heavy shower a few
hours later, but in the morning he was there upon
his perch in good spirits.</p>

<p>I happened to be passing in the morning
when another one came out. He hopped out upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
a limb, shook himself, and chirped and called
loudly. After some moments an idea seemed
to strike him. His attitude changed, his form
straightened up, and a thrill of excitement seemed
to run through him. I knew what it all meant;
something had whispered to the bird, "Fly!"
With a spring and a cry he was in the air, and
made good headway to a near hemlock. Others
left in a similar manner during that day and the
next, till all were out.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE DOWNY WOODPECKER</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bird that seems to consider he has the best
right to my hospitality is the downy woodpecker,
my favorite neighbor among the winter birds.
His retreat is but a few paces from my own, in
the decayed limb of an apple-tree, which he excavated
several autumns ago. I say "he" because
the red plume on the top of his head proclaims
the sex. It seems not to be generally known
to our writers upon ornithology that certain of our
woodpeckers&mdash;probably all the winter residents&mdash;each
fall excavate a limb or the trunk of a
tree in which to pass the winter, and that the cavity
is abandoned in the spring, probably for a
new one in which nidification takes place.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 328px;">
<img src="images/009.jpg" width="328" height="500" alt="" title="" />
DOWNY WOODPECKER</div>

<p>The particular woodpecker to which I refer
drilled his first hole in my apple-tree one fall
four or five years ago. This he occupied till the
following spring, when he abandoned it. The
next fall he began a hole in an adjoining limb,
later than before, and when it was about half completed
a female took possession of his old quarters.
I am sorry to say that this seemed to enrage
the male very much, and he persecuted the poor
bird whenever she appeared upon the scene. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
would fly at her spitefully and drive her off.
One chilly November morning, as I passed under
the tree, I heard the hammer of the little
architect in his cavity, and at the same time saw
the persecuted female sitting at the entrance of
the other hole as if she would fain come out.
She was actually shivering, probably from both
fear and cold. I understood the situation at a
glance; the bird was afraid to come forth and
brave the anger of the male. Not till I had
rapped smartly upon the limb with my stick did
she come out and attempt to escape; but she had
not gone ten feet from the tree before the male
was in hot pursuit, and in a few moments had
driven her back to the same tree, where she tried
to avoid him among the branches. There is probably
no gallantry among the birds except at the
mating season. I have frequently seen the male
woodpecker drive the female away from the bone
upon the tree. When she hopped around to the
other end and timidly nibbled it, he would presently
dart spitefully at her. She would then
take up her position in his rear and wait till he
had finished his meal. The position of the female
among the birds is very much the same as that
of women among savage tribes. Most of the
drudgery of life falls upon her, and the leavings
of the males are often her lot.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>My bird is a genuine little savage, doubtless,
but I value him as a neighbor. It is a satisfaction
during the cold or stormy winter nights to know
he is warm and cozy there in his retreat. When
the day is bad and unfit to be abroad in, he is
there too. When I wish to know if he is at home,
I go and rap upon his tree, and, if he is not too
lazy or indifferent, after some delay he shows
his head in his round doorway about ten feet
above, and looks down inquiringly upon me&mdash;sometimes
latterly I think half resentfully, as
much as to say, "I would thank you not to disturb
me so often." After sundown, he will not
put his head out any more when I call, but
as I step away I can get a glimpse of him inside
looking cold and reserved. He is a late riser,
especially if it is a cold or disagreeable morning,
in this respect being like the barn fowls; it is
sometimes near nine o'clock before I see him
leave his tree. On the other hand, he comes home
early, being in, if the day is unpleasant, by four
<span class="smcapl">P.M.</span> He lives all alone; in this respect I do not
commend his example. Where his mate is, I
should like to know.</p>

<p>I have discovered several other woodpeckers
in adjoining orchards, each of which has a like
home, and leads a like solitary life. One of them
has excavated a dry limb within easy reach of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
my hand, doing the work also in September. But
the choice of tree was not a good one; the limb
was too much decayed, and the workman had
made the cavity too large; a chip had come out,
making a hole in the outer wall. Then he went
a few inches down the limb and began again,
and excavated a large, commodious chamber, but
had again come too near the surface; scarcely
more than the bark protected him in one place,
and the limb was very much weakened. Then he
made another attempt still farther down the
limb, and drilled in an inch or two, but seemed
to change his mind; the work stopped, and I
concluded the bird had wisely abandoned the
tree. Passing there one cold, rainy November
day, I thrust in my two fingers and was surprised
to feel something soft and warm: as I drew
away my hand the bird came out, apparently no
more surprised than I was. It had decided, then,
to make its home in the old limb; a decision it
had occasion to regret, for not long after, on a
stormy night, the branch gave way and fell to
the ground:&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">"When the bough breaks the cradle will fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down will come baby and cradle and all."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another trait our woodpeckers have that endears
them to me is their habit of drumming in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the spring. They are songless birds, and yet all
are musicians; they make the dry limbs eloquent
of the coming change. Did you think that loud,
sonorous hammering which proceeded from the
orchard or from the near woods on that still
March or April morning was only some bird getting
its breakfast? It is Downy, but he is not rapping
at the door of a grub; he is rapping at the
door of spring, and the dry limb thrills beneath
the ardor of his blows.</p>

<p>A few seasons ago, a downy woodpecker, probably
the individual one who is now my winter
neighbor, began to drum early in March in a
partly decayed apple-tree that stands in the edge
of a narrow strip of woodland near me. When
the morning was still and mild I would often
hear him through my window before I was up, or
by half-past six o'clock, and he would keep it up
pretty briskly till nine or ten o'clock, in this respect
resembling the grouse, which do most of
their drumming in the forenoon. His drum was
the stub of a dry limb about the size of one's
wrist. The heart was decayed and gone, but the
outer shell was hard and resonant. The bird
would keep his position there for an hour at a
time. Between his drummings he would preen
his plumage and listen as if for the response of
the female, or for the drum of some rival. How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
swiftly his head would go when he was delivering
his blows upon the limb! His beak wore the surface
perceptibly. When he wished to change the
key, which was quite often, he would shift his
position an inch or two to a knot which gave
out a higher, shriller note. When I climbed up
to examine his drum, he was much disturbed. I
did not know he was in the vicinity, but it seems
he saw me from a near tree, and came in haste to
the neighboring branches, and with spread plumage
and a sharp note demanded plainly enough
what my business was with his drum. I was invading
his privacy, desecrating his shrine, and the
bird was much put out. After some weeks the
female appeared; he had literally drummed up a
mate; his urgent and oft-repeated advertisement
was answered. Still the drumming did not cease,
but was quite as fervent as before. If a mate could
be won by drumming, she could be kept and entertained
by more drumming; courtship should
not end with marriage. If the bird felt musical
before, of course he felt much more so now.
Besides that, the gentle deities needed propitiating
in behalf of the nest and young as well as in
behalf of the mate. After a time a second female
came, when there was war between the two. I did
not see them come to blows, but I saw one female
pursuing the other about the place, and giving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
her no rest for several days. She was evidently
trying to run her out of the neighborhood.
Now and then, she, too, would drum
briefly, as if sending a triumphant message to her
mate.</p>

<p>The woodpeckers do not each have a particular
dry limb to which they resort at all times to
drum, like the one I have described. The woods
are full of suitable branches, and they drum more
or less here and there as they are in quest of
food; yet I am convinced each one has its favorite
spot, like the grouse, to which it resorts
especially in the morning. The sugar-maker in
the maple woods may notice that this sound proceeds
from the same tree or trees about his camp
with great regularity. A woodpecker in my vicinity
has drummed for two seasons on a telegraph-pole,
and he makes the wires and glass insulators
ring. Another drums on a thin board
on the end of a long grape-arbor, and on still
mornings can be heard a long distance.</p>

<hr class="tb1" />

<p>I watch these woodpeckers daily to see if I
can solve the mystery as to how they hop up and
down the trunks and branches without falling
away from them when they let go their hold.
They come down a limb or trunk backward by a
series of little hops, moving both feet together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
If the limb is at an angle to the tree and they
are on the under side of it, they do not fall away
from it to get a new hold an inch or half-inch
farther down. They are held to it as steel to a
magnet. Both tail and head are involved in the
feat. At the instant of making the hop the head
is thrown in and the tail thrown out, but the
exact mechanics of it I cannot penetrate. Philosophers
do not yet know how a backward-falling
cat turns in the air, but turn she does.
It may be that the woodpecker never quite relaxes
his hold, though to my eye he appears to
do so.</p>
